When I was a high school senior, I was part of the first Honors Coding class. Belmont High didn't have AP CS until after I graduated.

Coding H was a joke of a class that culminated in a final Arduino project. Mine was a "robot" that played one of three Christmas jingles depending on how loud you screamed at it.

I honestly didn't see CS as an interesting major/career path at that time. 4 years later -- I run a tech blog and will be a full-time SWE post-grad. How the turn tables.

So for shits and gigs, I decided I would take the [AP Computer Science A Exam](https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a) with zero preparation.

## Expectations

I took Princeton's [COS 126](https://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/course-details?courseid=002051&term=1214) -- Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach -- my freshman fall. I'm imagining the AP CS exam to cover most of the material from this course. Throwback to this recruiting season when I got asked what are the [four fundamental priciples](https://info.keylimeinteractive.com/the-four-pillars-of-object-oriented-programming) of Object Oriented Programming and I could only name abstraction üôÉ So that pretty much summarizes how much I absorbed from COS 126.

From my understanding, the exam is only in Java. Despite Java still being listed on my resume under Skills > Languages, I have not touched it in almost two years ü§≠ There's a [Java Quick Reference](https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/ap/pdf/ap-computer-science-a-java-quick-reference_0.pdf) page that is allowed during the exam. Skimming over it, these methods look vaguely familiar. I am not brushing up on Java syntax or properties, and have not looked at a single example question before I take the exam.

The format is as such -- both sections are weighted 50% and 90 minutes each:

- 40 multiple choice
- 4 free response

I found a [full practice exam](http://compscimadison.weebly.com/uploads/5/8/7/4/58741529/ap-computer-science-a-2014-practice-exam.pdf) that I'll take. I'll be typing into the pdf and making comments as I go to avoid printing 68 pages. Since this is a practice exam, there isn't any info on scoring/curving. We will see how I do and try to estimate my score.

## Exam Day
