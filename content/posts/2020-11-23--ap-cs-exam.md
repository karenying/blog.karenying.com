When I was a high school senior, I was part of the first Honors Coding class my school offered. Belmont High didn't have AP CS until after I graduated.

Coding H was a joke of a class that culminated in a final Arduino project. Mine was a "robot" that played one of three Christmas jingles depending on how loud you screamed at it.

I honestly didn't see CS as an interesting major/career path at that time. Four years later -- I run a tech blog and will be a full-time SWE post-grad. How the turn tables.

So for shits and gigs, I decided I would take the [AP Computer Science A Exam](https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a) with zero preparation.

## Expectations

I took Princeton's [COS 126](https://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/course-details?courseid=002051&term=1214) -- Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach -- my freshman fall. I'm imagining the AP CS exam to cover most of the material from this course.

**Throwback to this recruiting season when I got asked what are the [four fundamental principles](https://info.keylimeinteractive.com/the-four-pillars-of-object-oriented-programming) of Object Oriented Programming and I could only name abstraction 🙃**

So that pretty much sums up how much I absorbed from COS 126.

From my understanding, the exam is only in Java. Despite Java still being listed on my resume under _Skills > Languages_, I haven't touched it in almost two years 🤭 There's a [Java Quick Reference](https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/ap/pdf/ap-computer-science-a-java-quick-reference_0.pdf) page attached to the exam. I'm not brushing up on Java syntax or properties, and have not looked at a single example question before I take the exam.

The format is as such -- both sections are weighted 50% and 90 minutes each:

- 40 multiple choice (MC)
- 4 free response (FR)

Unfortunately, there aren't full past exams released online (MC is always missing). I found a [practice exam](http://compscimadison.weebly.com/uploads/5/8/7/4/58741529/ap-computer-science-a-2014-practice-exam.pdf) instead. I'll be typing into the PDF and making comments as I go. Since this is a practice exam, there isn't any info on scoring/curving. We will see how I do and try to estimate my score.

## Exam Day

Checklist for success:

- Review the material the night before ❌
- Get a full night's rest ❌
- Eat a solid breakfast ✅
- Wear comfortable clothes ✅

Let's get this 🥖

### Multiple Choice

MC felt like a goddammed marathon.

I had my guard up for every question. I double and tripled checked my logic because I didn't wanna get bamboozled. I left a couple of hard/tedious ones to revisit.

The quick reference sheet definitely came in handy.

Some comments I wrote while taking:

> oh no<br>
> does casting to an int truncate??<br>
> I think so...<br>
> if not I’m literally inting<br>

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
> said outloud: oh my god<br>
> just wrote out a truth table to confirm that !&& = ||<br> 
> _\*attempts\*_<br>
> lmao this isn’t ans isn’t on there let’s try again<br>
> ok turns out I read my truth table wrong and !&& != || :( let’s try applying the ! to both sides<br> 
> _\*attempts again\*_<br>
> ok at least this answer is on there lmfao<br>
> _\*gets it wrong\*_

> wait what’s the diff between interface and class oh no

> omg is this what constructors are supposed to look like

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
> _\*attempts\*_<br>
> rip this isn’t on there uh<br>
> lemme come back to this if I have time<br>
> _\*revisits\*_<br>
> aight take two<br> 
> _\*attempts again\*_<br>
> FUCK why is this still not an answer<br> 
> _\*attempt #3\*_<br>
> alright we’re just gonna guess<br>

Overall, it just felt really long and my brain became increasingly fried. Some questions were definitely tricky!

### Free Response

I forgot you had to write actual Java for this section. I briefly questioned why Java was still on my resume before I started the FR and sent up a prayer to the semicolon gods.

Thankfully, the MC eased me into remembering how freaking verbose the language is. I mostly code in JavaScript nowadays which is syntactically similar-ish to Java? I've also been writing C for OS which also definitely helped (Java is a descendant).

This section was way easier for me than MC. I barely had time to check my work for MC but I finished FR with 38 minutes to spare. I pretty much knew how to go about the solutions once I understood the prompts. I would say these were on the same level, if not easier than LeetCode easys. The hardest part was the amount of words I had to read.

## Results

I scored 36/40 on MC and 35/36 on FR -- which is around **~93.6%** on the exam. I would say that's pretty solidly a 5 on any curve 🎉

I had ex-Facebook, ex-Google, ex-Airbnb (read: a real sOfTwArE eNgiNeEr) ... also my ex, [Victor Zhou](http://victorzhou.com/), comment on my results.

- **Blue**: me during exam
- **Red**: me grading
- **Green**: Vic commenting after

### Multiple Choice

I missed 4 MC.

- **\#16**: definitely just careless
- **\#19**: I suck at boolean operators and logic
- **\#22**: didn't realize that when a subclass is declared as its parent class, it can only call parent methods, and not its own methods damn
- **\#23**: I misread a for loop bound rip and rode the struggle 🚌 three times

### Free Response

Vic tells me that nested methods in Java is not a thing:

> im pretty sure this doesn’t even come close to compiling

Unclear if I would lose points for that.

The only point I would have lost otherwise is when I divided a `double` by an `int` (`4`) instead of a `double` (`4.0`) 🤦🏻‍♀️ ugh strong typed languages.

Compared to the sample solutions, mine were a bit tidier/easier to read because I made sure to create helper methods and proper variable names whenever possible. Perhaps Java will not be ceremoniously yeeted off my resume after all.

## Conclusion

I said to Vic:

> The exam was way easier than I thought and my results are less interesting than I hoped

to which he replied

> yeah seems like a 5 told u this was gonna be super ez

and that pretty much summarizes this experiment.

Thanks for reading!
