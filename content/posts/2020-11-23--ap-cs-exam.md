When I was a high school senior, my school offered Honors Coding for the first time. Belmont High didn't have AP CS until after I graduated.

Coding H was a joke of a class that culminated in a final Arduino project. Mine was a "robot" that played one of three Christmas jingles depending on how loud you screamed at it.

I honestly didn't see CS as an interesting major/career path at that time. 4 years later -- I run a tech blog and will be a full-time SWE post-grad?

So for shits and gigs, I decided I would take the [AP Computer Science A Exam](https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a) with zero preparation.
