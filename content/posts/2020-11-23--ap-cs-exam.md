When I was a high school senior, my school offered Honors Coding for the first time. Belmont High didn't have AP CS until after I graduated.

Coding H was a joke of a class that culminated in a final Arduino project. Mine was a "robot" that played one of three Christmas jingles depending on how loud you screamed at it.

I honestly didn't see CS as an interesting major/career path at that time. 4 years later -- I run a tech blog and will be a full-time SWE post-grad?

So for shits and gigs, I decided I would take the [AP Computer Science A Exam](https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a) with zero preparation.

## Expectations

I took Princeton's [COS 126](https://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/course-details?courseid=002051&term=1214) -- Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach -- my freshman fall. I'm imagining the AP CS exam to cover most of the material from this course.

From my understanding, the exam is only in Java (which I haven't touched in two years). There's a [Java Quick Reference](https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/ap/pdf/ap-computer-science-a-java-quick-reference_0.pdf) page that is allowed during the exam.

The format is as such, both weighted 50% and 90 minutes each:

- 40 multiple choice
- 4 free response

I found a [full practice exam](http://compscimadison.weebly.com/uploads/5/8/7/4/58741529/ap-computer-science-a-2014-practice-exam.pdf) that I'll take.

I am not brushing up on Java syntax or properties, and have not looked at a single example question before I take the exam. I'm going in completely blind.
