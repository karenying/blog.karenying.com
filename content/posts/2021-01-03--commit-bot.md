_**Disclaimer**: This is a dumb post, partly due to security vulnerabilities but mostly because no one cares what your contributions graph looks like._

Are you trying to impress recruiters and / or that cute coworker you noticed on a company-wide Zoom call last week? Do you feel inadequate when you have a ~~dick~~ commit-measuring contest with ~the boys~? Or do you just have commitment issues? Don't worry, I'm not here to judge. I am here to fix your woes.

## Implementation

_**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: This bot was configured on macOS Catalina. It has **NOT** been tested on anything else. Setting it up can also cause security vulnerabilities. **Implement at your own risk.** ‚ö†Ô∏è_

### The TL;DR

We'll use a python script to randomize and execute the commits -- it'd be weird if you committed the same amount of times every day. Then we'll run a local cron job to execute the script.

### 1. Clone my repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/karenying/commit-bot.git
```

There are two files in this repo: `app.py` and `output.txt`.

Let's take a look at `app.py`:

```python
# Header: app.py

from os import system
from random import randint

THRESHOLD = 3
MAX_COMMITS = 3

def commit():
  system("echo $(date) >> output.txt")
  system("git add output.txt")
  system("git commit -m Update output.txt")
  system("git push")

if (randint(0, 10) > THRESHOLD):
  for i in range(randint(0, MAX_COMMITS)):
    commit()
```

The `commit` function writes the current datetime to `output.txt`. It then adds, commits, and pushes the change. We use the `os` module to execute the git commands via terminal.

In order to randomize, we generate a random integer between 0 and 10 and check if it's greater than a set threshold; The **larger** the threshold, the **less** frequently the commits will occur. If the random int passes the threshold, we generate another random int between 0 and `MAX_COMMITS`. We then commit that many times.

**Change `THRESHOLD` and `MAX_COMMITS` to suit your needs.** Feel free to change the commit message as well.

### 2. Create a new private repo

Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new repo. Name it whatever you want but make sure you hit **private** (unless you want everyone to see that you're a fraud ü§™):

![private repo](/media/github-commit-bot/private_repo.png)

Next, we need to connect our cloned repo to this newly created repo:

```bash
rm -rf .git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/[USERNAME]/[REPO NAME].git
git push --set-upstream origin master
```

Great. Now if you visit your new repo on GitHub, you should see `app.py` and `output.txt`.

**One more thing.** On your profile, check that private contributions are on:

### 3. Grant Full Disk Access to cron

We need to give cron access to your files in order for it to run `app.py`.

_**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: This is **NOT** a good security practice. A malicious person / program could create cron jobs that also have Full Disk Access and modify your data. ‚ö†Ô∏è_

Navigate to **System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Full Disk Access**:

![full disk access](/media/github-commit-bot/full_disk_access.png)

Click the üîí and then the **+** sign. Open _Go to Folder_ with `‚åò ‚áß G` and enter the path `/usr/sbin/cron`. Select the cron program and hit _Open_. Click the lock again.

### 4. Save GitHub credentials on disk

Cron also needs access to your GitHub credentials. So we're gonna cache them on your computer.

_**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: This is **NOT** a good security practice. It stores your GitHub credentials as plaintext on your computer. This means that malicious NPM packages can access them. ‚ö†Ô∏è_

If you can sleep at night knowing that, then proceed with:

```bash
git config credential.helper store
```

### 5. Create a cron job

Finally, we're ready to schedule our cron job. We'll be using crontab which is native to macOS / linux.

First, pick **when** you want the cron job to run. For example, I chose 10:30 AM every day because I know my computer will most likely be awake then. See this [site](https://crontab.guru/) if you're unfamiliar with cron syntax.

For 10:30 AM daily, the cron job time prefix would be `30 10 * * *`.

Immediately following this, we have the command that we want the job to execute: `cd [PATH TO FOLDER] && python3 app.py`.

Here's my job with the time and command together:

```bash
30 10 * * * cd ~/Documents/commit-bot && python3 app.py
```

To add this job, in your terminal:

```bash
crontab -e
```

This will open up a Vim editor. Paste in the one-liner from above. Write and quit with `:wq`.

**And that's it!** Hopefully after these steps, you've successfully set up your commit bot.

## Conclusion

Security vulnerabilities aside, this commit bot will stack your contributions graph. You're welcome. Now when people see your GitHub profile, they will think _damn this person codes_.

I personally don't use this bot because **1.** the aforementioned security issues and **2.** I _think_ I [already](https://github.com/karenying) look like I code üòâ

Anyway, congrats! You are officially on your way to becoming **the guy she tells you not to worry about**.

_Thanks for reading. Happy hacking!_
