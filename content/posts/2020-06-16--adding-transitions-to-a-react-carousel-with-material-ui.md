Interested in jazzing up a boring React carousel? In this post, we use [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/), an insanely popular and easy-to-use React library, to add sliding transitions.

**Bonus**: stick around to see how to implement arrow-key navigation controls.

If you are only interested in the transitions, skip ahead to **step 4**, else we‚Äôre coding this carousel from scratch. There are already a bunch of [npm packages](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=react%20carousel) for React carousels, but implementing it ourselves gives us more customization flexibility. It‚Äôs also fun and pretty simple!

The **GitHub repo** for all the code below can be found [**here**](https://github.com/karenying/react-carousel). See the deployed version [**here**](https://react-carousel-with-transitions.netlify.app/).

### Prereqs

This tutorial assumes you have some knowledge of React, function components, and hooks. All good? Let‚Äôs get started üëçüèº

## Implementation

### 0. Getting set up

We‚Äôll use [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) to create, bundle, and run the project:

```bash
$ npx create-react-app react-carousel
$ cd react-carousel
$ npm start
```

‚Ä¶and add some dependencies ‚Äî Material-UI for the transitions, and [React Icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-icons) for the cute arrows:

```bash
$ npm install @material-ui/core
$ npm install react-icons
```

Before we start creating components, we need to update `App.css` to use CSS Flexbox to format our page:

`gist:karenying/1d2f22d1a00e7f7922dcb47e9736bf4c/app-css`

Yay let‚Äôs write some React components!

### 1. Setting up slide component

In a new file, `CarouselSlide.js`, we‚Äôre going to create our slide component which takes in a single prop, `content`.

`content` will be a JS object with the properties `backgroundColor`, and `title` which will determine the background color and the title of the current slide respectively (obviously üòõ).

We‚Äôre also using Material-UI‚Äôs [Card](https://material-ui.com/components/cards/) component and `makeStyles` hook to style the slide. More info on Material-UI custom styling can be found [here](https://material-ui.com/styles/basics/).

Here‚Äôs the code for `CarouselSlide.js`:

`gist:karenying/ef9aa2d89cb7097e65ee3c1a5fa35d56/carouselslide-js`

To get the slide to render, we‚Äôll create some props for `content` and update `App.js`:

`gist:karenying/d30029b8b0004f535970c2fcf357e3c1/app-js`

Okay! After running `npm start`, we should see something like this on http://localhost:3000/:

Super super simple. Now let‚Äôs add some more content to iterate through in our carousel.

### 2. Generating slide content

We‚Äôre gonna put all our slide info in a new file called `constants.js`. It‚Äôll take the shape of an array of objects that have the same structure as the `content` prop we worked with above:

`gist:karenying/4bbb25dc3f545417086a1c658b1ca554/constants-js`

With `constants.js`, we can refactor `App.js` to import and index into `SLIDE_INFO`:

`gist:karenying/7961078e3ce798986f42082832f1cb02/app-js`

Since we indexed into the 4th item, the rendered slide should be yellow with the title ‚ÄúSlide 4‚Äù:

### 3. Changing content on click with arrows

Time to add some arrows.

We‚Äôre just gonna create a super simple `Arrow` function component that takes in a direction and click function. We‚Äôll use some arrow SVGs from React-Icon. Adding it to `App.js`:

`gist:karenying/d3f932b9d433a8ed61bf58838d168b7b/app-js `

Next, we need to implement the click handler.

We‚Äôll use the `useState` hook to keep track of which slide we‚Äôre currently on with the state variable `index`. Then we use this state variable to index into `SLIDE_INFO`.

The right and left click handlers need to increment and decrement `index` respectively to change the currently rendered slide.

Instead of handling the two directions separately, like the `Arrow` component above, we‚Äôll combine the logic in one function called `onArrowClick`.

`onArrowClick` takes in a direction and updates `index` appropriately:

`gist:karenying/e2886659c1de3a51226626c3f6c59cb7/app-js`

Note: in **line 7** above, we add `numSlides` to the sum of `index` and `increment`, and mod it by `numSlides`. This ensures that we always be within the range of `0` and `numSlides ‚Äî 1` to stay in bounds.

Finally, we update the return statement of `App.js` to render the arrows:

`gist:karenying/1cfda17b3fab2bb6f1ca703250bca3ca/app-js`

and style the arrow SVGs in `App.css`:

`gist:karenying/e9426c28ccc93433b747e1add8a49363/app-css`

After this step, we have a working carousel:

‚Ä¶but it looks awfully plain üòû Let‚Äôs add some transitions!

### 4. Adding transitions with Material-UI

The transition we‚Äôre using is Material-UI‚Äôs [Slide API](https://material-ui.com/api/slide/). We‚Äôll have to create two new state variables: `slideIn`, and `slideDirection` to correspond with Slide‚Äôs `in` and `direction` props respectively.

`in` dictates when the component appears if true, and when the component exits if `false`.

`direction` dictates where the component _enters from_. This means that without changing direction, the component enters and exits from the same `direction`. This is not the desired effect we want for a carousel! The slides must enter and exit from opposite directions to give the appearance of moving left or right across the page. Thus, we need to change `direction` in between setting `in` from `false` to `true`.

We also need to use `setTimeout` so that the previous slide has time to exit before the next slide enters.

After updating `slideIn` and `slideDirection` in `onArrowClick`, we‚Äôve added:

`gist:karenying/848371ea8cad01eb5689bb552a31f59a/app-js`

Note: in **line 2**, we set the initial value of `slideDirection` to `'down'` so the carousel slides down on the first render.

Finally, we want to wrap our `CarouselSlide` component with an extra `div` since Material-UI‚Äôs Slide‚Äôs child ‚Äú[needs to be able to hold a ref](https://material-ui.com/guides/composition/#caveat-with-refs).‚Äù Then we pass in our state variables into `Slide` and our updated return statement now looks like:

`gist:karenying/4ea450cb71eff46428cff24e9e12c2c4/app-js`

Yay üéâ

We got the slide transitions to work. This is what the carousel should look like now:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2116/1*6U-7al8M3bAs0-4uTNtlfg.gif)

If you think the transitions are too fast, you can use the timeout prop from the [Slide API](https://material-ui.com/api/slide/) and adjust it to your speed.

Anyways, it looks great üòÖ Good job!

But how nice would it be if you could navigate through the carousel with just **arrow keys**? Luckily, it‚Äôs only a couple of lines of code.

### 5. Binding arrow keys for navigation

We just have to add a `keydown` event listener and call `onArrowClick` for the appropriate direction. Remember to cleanup the event listener when the component unmounts!

We can put all the key handling logic in `useEffect`:

`gist:karenying/67192e644c76dcb4621a37e737f005b2/app-js`

Woohoo! We‚Äôre officially done üôÇ

If you got lost along the way, here‚Äôs the [**GitHub repo**](https://github.com/karenying/react-carousel). The commits correspond with each of the steps listed above. You can also play with the [**deployed version**](https://react-carousel-with-transitions.netlify.app/).

## Extensions

Here are some more things you can do to add to your simple carousel:

- Add images

- Make it responsive: Material-UI makes it pretty easy with [breakpoints](https://material-ui.com/customization/breakpoints/) and their [Hidden](https://material-ui.com/components/hidden/) component

- Use other Material-UI [transitions](https://material-ui.com/components/transitions/)

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we implemented a React carousel from scratch. Then we added slide transitions with Material-UI and key controls! I‚Äôve added a couple of suggestions above on how to take it to another level.

Carousels look great on personal sites, blogs, and product sites. Jazzing it up makes them more interesting and interactive.

Thanks for reading. Happy hacking!
