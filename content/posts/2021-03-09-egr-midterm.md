> We’re still trying to hire a lot of frontend engineers and it would be nice if everyone wasn’t male… What would it take for you to apply?

That is how I landed my current job — software engineer at an early stage startup. Before I got into computer science, I did theoretical and competition math, another heavily male-dominated field. For every math camp, math program, and now software engineering job, I got, I couldn’t help but wonder if I got special treatment because of my gender. This is an account of my experience with imposter syndrome, how it's shaped my life, and what I've done about it.

## Diagnosis: Moderate case of imposter syndrome

### Patient History

I first noticed this phenomenon my freshman summer of high school when I got into an elite theoretical math camp (I actually wrote my college applications essay about my experience with imposter syndrome there). My best guy friend at the time told me he was applying so I also applied on a whim. I got in and he didn't. He was pretty upset and told me I only got in because I was a girl. The acceptance rate was around 5x higher for girls than guys, yet the camp was only a quarter girls.

The acceptance statistic stuck in my head for the longest time. For the first couple of weeks, I found the problem sets impossible to complete. Everyone else seemed to be fine though? I silently suffered, grinding through the problems, feeling like I was so so stupid compared to my peers -- International Math Olympiad and American Math Competition winners.

Another obvious example is Princeton. My freshman year, I felt like I was back at math camp again -- surrounded by brilliant people and I couldn't compare at all. Staying afloat academics was challenging. I questioned if my admission was a mistake.

This past summer I interned at a healthcare startup as a software engineer. I was first female engineer intern the company ever had in its 5-year history. Out of the 12 engineers, the only other woman was my mentor. My mentor has a Bachelor's degree in physics, then went to medical school, and finally completed a coding bootcamp before joining the company. She was the 3rd hire and had been at the company for over 5 years. Yet, I was there when she was promoted to Senior Software Engineer. All the other male engineers at the company were already considered Senior at the time. I remember feeling so surprised to find out that she wasn't Senior until her promotion. Did it take so long because of her gender? If I stayed at the company, would I have the same fate -- taking longer to get promoted than my male peers? Was I just worse at coding than the other male intern? These were all questions that floated in my head the entire summer.

Finally, this past January, I started interning as a software engineer again at another early stage startup. This is where the opening quote came from. I felt imposter syndrome pretty strongly. It makes sense that the feeling is most intense when I'm thrown into a new environment. It's steadily improved over the last two months!

### Symptoms and Side Effects

Imposter syndrome at its core is a _feeling of not belonging_. I feel like I am different from my peers, worse at X compared to them. It's a constant worry that they looked past my incompetence but eventually they'll find out that I'm not as good as they thought I was.
