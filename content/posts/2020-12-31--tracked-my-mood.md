In **December 2019**, I saw a [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/ehz6di/i_decided_to_keep_track_of_how_each_day_in_2019/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) titled "I decided to keep track of how each day in 2019 went for me" and thought I too wanted to keep track of my days for 2020. So I made a similar [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D9-rCOvZ2aekkK3pYQw-7tHW3TcxV0UnGJZm_DeWiXk/edit?usp=sharing).

Around that time I was also starting my web dev ~journey~. What better way to learn than to build a full-stack mood tracker web app to replace the spreadsheet? That's exactly how Dayz and this post came to be.

## Dayz ‚òÄÔ∏è

![](/media/tracked-my-mood-daily-2020/dayz.png)

The backend is [Express](https://expressjs.com/) on top of a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database with a [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) ODM. It's a [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) frontend, bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app). I deployed it with free-tier [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and ran a [cron job](https://cron-job.org/en/) that pinged the site every half hour to prevent the app from [falling asleep](https://blog.heroku.com/app_sleeping_on_heroku).

There are 4 **timeframe views**: Day, Week, Month, and Year. In Week view only (I got lazy / the app is unfinished), you could click a day and rate it on this **scale**: Bad day, Off day, Normal day, Good day, and Great day -- like the original spreadsheet I made.

I got the app to a usable state and gave up working on it. But I set a daily reminder to rate my day at night:

And that's how I ended up tracking my mood for every day of 2020. Here's what the data told me.

## Trends

**Some background on my life**: I spent the first half of 2020 as a Junior at Princeton and the second half as a Senior. I did a remote summer internship between the academic years, and have been living at home (Boston, MA) since mid-March (Princeton yeeted us off campus when pandemic hit).

**Every screenshot of the app below has a color blind friendly version. Hover over (desktop) or press (mobile) to reveal.** I used a palette from [Paul Tol](https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/#sec:qualitative) and hosted images on [Imgur](https://imgur.com/) in order to the get HTML to play nice with Gatsby and markdown.

_I also recognize these are NOT the easiest colors to distinguish and not the best for conveying data but I like them. The color blind friendly palette is less of a gradient and perhaps more distinguishable._

### Inflated Ratings

From the way I defined the scale, theoretically my ratings should be a **symmetric distribution**, centered around Normal day. This was not the case at all:

<span style="color:#FF2600">[PIC OF YEAR COUNTS]</span>

Let's give numeric values to each type of day: **Bad = 0, Off = 1, Normal = 2, Good = 3, Great = 4**. And take the average. We get <span style="color:#FF2600">[SOME QUICK MATHS]</span>, greater than 2 (normal). I had an inflated perception of what each day was actually like.

This makes sense with my personality -- I generally have a positive outlook on life. Therefore, on average, I was more generous with my ratings, thinking I had a better day than what the scale defined.

I rated so few days as Bad that I can distinctly remember what went down in those 6 days. I can't say the same about my 25 Great days though.

### Pandemic

I chose an interesting year to start this experiment huh. It's not every year a global pandemic hits. Covid for sure had an impact on the data. This is how cases trended in Massachusetts where I've been living for the majority of the year:

<span style="color:#FF2600">[NYT PIC]</span>

_**Source**: [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/massachusetts-coronavirus-cases.html#cases)_

My mood generally correlated with case counts / restrictions. When cases are lower and restrictions were looser, I was happier.

This is the month of **April** where all I did was cross stitch while binge-watching [Bon Appetite](https://www.youtube.com/user/BonAppetitDotCom) videos:

<div class="mood">
  <img class="color" src="https://i.imgur.com/O7ZNhoz.png" alt="april">
  <img class="colorblind" src="https://i.imgur.com/h0mzfFI.png" alt="april">
</div>

Not a single Great day and 2/3 of the month were Normal. Compare that to **July** when Covid restrictions eased up and I got to see friends:

<div class="mood">
  <img class="color" src="https://i.imgur.com/x2na4Vh.png" alt="july">
  <img class="colorblind" src="https://i.imgur.com/z72HG7c.png" alt="july">
</div>

Cases started rising again in the fall and my mood adjusted accordingly -- goodbye Great days:

<div class="mood">

  <img class="colorblind" src="https://i.imgur.com/bvUsCy8.png" alt="nov">
</div>

### Seasonal Depression

I have a self-diagnosed mild case of seasonal depression. Being outside and getting sun makes me happy. Summer is my favorite season by far. Thus, I had way more Great days when the weather was warmer:

<span style="color:#FF2600">[YEAR VIEW]</span>

### Bad Days Get Better!

On 3/3, I went through a breakup which was definitely the lowest point of the year. I wallowed in misery for a solid two days -- didn't leave my room, couldn't eat, constantly crying etc. I tracked every day during this period:

<div class="mood">
  <img class="color" src="https://i.imgur.com/5LqcDs4.png" alt="bad days">
  <img class="colorblind" src="https://i.imgur.com/iNNaYBE.png" alt="bad days">
</div>

In the moment, it felt like I'd never be happy again. But with every passing day, it hurt a little less and the graph above reflects that.

Now, when I feel down, I think about those days in March, and remind myself that Great days are just around the corner üëçüèº

## Conclusion

What a year! I'm glad I conducted this experiment.

**First**, I absolutely adored coding a full stack app from scratch -- I learned tons in the process. And **second**, I appreciated how I got to reflect on my day every night, as well as on the entire year through this post.

I can't believe I'm saying this but overall, **2020 was a Good year for me**. Lotsa growth and development, both skill-wise and personal-wise.

If I could make Dayz from scratch, I would implement:

- Express serving my React app -- might solve some CORS / HTTP vs HTTPS issues
- Different / more organized React component structure
- Typescript and Sass
- State management
- Responsiveness, or just full send into mobile only
- Passwords + account management / general account security

The fact that it currently doesn't have these things really demotivates me from working on the app.

So where does that leave this project?

I'm definitely **not** releasing Dayz to the public in its current state (@ the last bullet) but I think I'll continue to track daily. If I get enough interest, I _could_ be convinced to rebuild it from scratch, with those aforementioned features. Or if you're wanna take over the project, [email me](mailto:karenying7@gmail.com). Regardless, hopefully catch ya at "I Tracked My Mood for Every Day of 2021".

Happy New Year and here's to many Great days that will come ü•Ç

_Thanks for reading!_
