## Definite Ranking

### S Tier

1. [Blogmas 2020](https://blog.karenying.com/posts/blogmas-2020)
   - Hands down the post I put the most time, effort, and love into. Check out the semi-interactive [calendar](https://www.blogmas.karenying.com/) if you haven't already! Had an actual blast posting daily and learned tons along the way
2. [I Tracked My Mood for Every Day of 2020]()
   - Another long term project. Some pretty interesting trends came out of it and the app itself definitely holds a special place in my heart
3. [The Ultimate Guide to Becoming a VSCode Girl](https://blog.karenying.com/posts/vscode-girl)
   - The shitpost that literally no one asked for but the one that I felt like I was meant to write. "Have you always been this funny?" -- a friends after reading it
4. [50 Shades of Dark Mode Gray](https://blog.karenying.com/posts/50-shades-of-dark-mode-gray)
   - This post combines my appreciation for dark mode and my inclination to inspect element on everything. The predecessor to the next post on this list

### A Tier

5. [GitHub Dark Mode is Too Dark](https://blog.karenying.com/posts/github-darkmode-sucks)
   - Making it on HN is sucha milestone. I didn't really edit the version of this post that I put out because obviously I didn't think it'd get as big as it did. But I'm pretty happy with the final / current version
6. [Hack Keyboard Shortcuts Into Sites with a Custom Chrome Extension](https://blog.karenying.com/posts/hack-keyboard-shortcuts-into-sites-with-a-custom-chrome-extension)
   - I'm sucha avid user of GCal and I still use the extension I made in this tutorial daily. The concept itself is so dope. Like you can add custom shortcuts to web apps with a Chrome extension??
7. [404: React Page Not Found](https://blog.karenying.com/posts/404-react-page-not-found)
   - I'm glad this post has pretty good SEO and can help people who ran into the same mysterious bug that I did. Pretty fun to dive into source code to find answers
8. [Pixels vs. Bricks](https://blog.karenying.com/posts/pixels-vs-bricks)
   - It was cool to put my limited architecture knowledge to use. The comparisons aren't perfect but I tried
9. 2020 Blogging Recap
   - Aka this post. We stan self-reflection

### B Tier

10. [Quarantine Day 259: Princeton CS Senior Takes the AP CS Exam](https://blog.karenying.com/posts/ap-cs-exam)
    - I wish this post was a YouTube video instead. Pretty funny idea. Kinda disappointing results
11. [Boost Visual Accessibility by Auto Flipping Text Color](https://blog.karenying.com/posts/boost-visual-accessibility-by-auto-flipping-text-color)
    - Mixed feels towards this one. It took me a long time to write and is probably too complicated for its own good. But I stand by the intent
12. [Customize Chrome New Tab Page in 30 Seconds](https://blog.karenying.com/posts/customize-chrome-new-tab-page-in-30-seconds)
    - I really do adore the custom new tab page I built. Makes me feel like my browsing experience is personal. The tutorial itself is kinda just okay though
13. [Adding Transitions to a React Carousel with Material-UI](https://blog.karenying.com/posts/adding-transitions-to-a-react-carousel-with-material-ui)
    - Another post that does well with SEO. Material UI is kinda meh tho. This probably coulda been done with simple CSS.
14. [Let 2020 be the year PNG icons die](https://blog.karenying.com/posts/let-2020-be-the-year-png-icons-die)
    - My first post! Why is it so angsty lmfao

    - Ya why is this also so angsty jeez
17. [Configuring a Mac for a PC User](https://blog.karenying.com/posts/configuring-a-mac-for-a-pc-user)
    - The only person this helped was my mom
18. [Simple React Router Nav Bar](https://blog.karenying.com/posts/nav-bar-with-dots)
    - Didn't enjoy writing this one and I can't remember why. Think there isn't much explanation and it's kinda just like here's the code
19. [Annoy (or Impress) Your Coworkers with a Slack Bot From Scratch](https://blog.karenying.com/posts/annoy-or-impress-your-coworkers-with-a-slack-bot-from-scratch)
