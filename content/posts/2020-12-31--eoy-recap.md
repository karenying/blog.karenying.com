## Definitive Ranking

### S Tier

1. [**Blogmas 2020**](https://blog.karenying.com/posts/blogmas-2020)
   - Hands down the post I put the most time, effort, and love into. Peep the semi-interactive [calendar visualizer](https://www.blogmas.karenying.com/)! Had an actual blast posting daily and learned tons along the way
2. [**I Tracked My Mood Every Day of 2020**]()
   - Another long term project. Some pretty interesting trends came out of it and the app itself definitely holds a special place in my heart
3. [**The Ultimate Guide to Becoming a VSCode Girl**](https://blog.karenying.com/posts/vscode-girl)
   - The shitpost that literally no one asked for but the one that I felt like I was meant to write. "Have you always been this funny?" -- a friend after reading it
4. [**50 Shades of Dark Mode Gray**](https://blog.karenying.com/posts/50-shades-of-dark-mode-gray)
   - This post combines my appreciation for dark mode and my inclination to inspect element on everything. The predecessor to the next post on this list

### A Tier

5. [**GitHub Dark Mode is Too Dark**](https://blog.karenying.com/posts/github-darkmode-sucks)
   - Making it on HN is sucha milestone. I didn't really edit the version of this post that I put out because obviously I didn't think it'd get as big as it did. But I'm pretty happy with the final / current version
6. [**Hack Keyboard Shortcuts Into Sites with a Custom Chrome Extension**](https://blog.karenying.com/posts/hack-keyboard-shortcuts-into-sites-with-a-custom-chrome-extension)
   - I'm an avid user of GCal and I still use the extension I made in this tutorial daily. The concept itself is so dope. Like you can add custom shortcuts to web apps with a Chrome extension?? Wat
7. [**404: React Page Not Found**](https://blog.karenying.com/posts/404-react-page-not-found)
   - I'm glad this post has pretty good SEO and can help people who ran into the same mysterious bug that I did. Pretty fun to dive into source code to find answers
8. [**Pixels vs. Bricks**](https://blog.karenying.com/posts/pixels-vs-bricks)
   - It was cool to put my limited architecture knowledge to use. The comparisons aren't perfect but I tried
9. **2020 Blogging Recap**
   - Aka this post. We stan self-reflection

### B Tier

10. [**Quarantine Day 259: Princeton CS Senior Takes the AP CS Exam**](https://blog.karenying.com/posts/ap-cs-exam)
    - I wish this post was a YouTube video instead. Pretty funny idea. Kinda disappointing results
11. [**Boost Visual Accessibility by Auto Flipping Text Color**](https://blog.karenying.com/posts/boost-visual-accessibility-by-auto-flipping-text-color)
    - Mixed feels towards this one. It took me a long time to write and is probably too complicated for its own good. But I stand by the content / message
12. [**Customize Chrome New Tab Page in 30 Seconds**](https://blog.karenying.com/posts/customize-chrome-new-tab-page-in-30-seconds)
    - I really do adore the custom new tab page I built. Makes me feel like my browsing experience is personal. The tutorial itself is kinda just okay though
13. [**Adding Transitions to a React Carousel with Material-UI**](https://blog.karenying.com/posts/adding-transitions-to-a-react-carousel-with-material-ui)
    - Another post that does well with SEO. But Material UI is kinda meh. This probably coulda been done with simple CSS.
14. [**Let 2020 be the year PNG icons die**](https://blog.karenying.com/posts/let-2020-be-the-year-png-icons-die)
    - My first post! Why is it so angsty lmfao

### C Tier

15. [**v2.0 Stable Release**](https://blog.karenying.com/posts/v2-0-stable-release)
    - Blogging on my own site >> Medium
16. [**Iâ€™m a Gen Z-er and I want you to stop using emojis**](https://blog.karenying.com/posts/i%E2%80%99m-a-gen-z-er-and-i-want-you-to-stop-using-emojis)
    - Ya why is this also so angsty jeez
17. [**Configuring a Mac for a PC User**](https://blog.karenying.com/posts/configuring-a-mac-for-a-pc-user)
    - The only person this helped was my mom
18. [**Simple React Router Nav Bar**](https://blog.karenying.com/posts/nav-bar-with-dots)
    - Didn't enjoy writing this one and I can't remember why. Think there isn't much explanation and it's kinda just like here's the code
19. [**Annoy (or Impress) Your Coworkers with a Slack Bot From Scratch**](https://blog.karenying.com/posts/annoy-or-impress-your-coworkers-with-a-slack-bot-from-scratch)
    - Please don't follow this tutorial it's actually bad
