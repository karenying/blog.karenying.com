## VSCode

In order to be a VSCode Girl, you gotta [download VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and use it as your main IDE of course. What do you think I'm writing this blog post from?

Here are some extensions I love:

- [favorites](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=howardzuo.vscode-favorites): pin files/folders for easy access
- [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens): the best GitHub integration
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode): make sure you [format on save](https://scottsauber.com/2017/06/10/prettier-format-on-save-never-worry-about-formatting-javascript-again/)

## GitHub

Ah yes, the social media platform for brogrammers.

Some greatest hits:

> What's your favorite stack? Mine is me on top of you

Ugh gross ü§Æ

> Are you http? Because me without you is just ://

Pretty clever but are you insecure? Why not HTTPS smh

> Is this entire profile just an ad

Yes.

> // TODO: go on a date with [REDACTED]

I don't leave comments in my prod code oop

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
> if ([REDACTED] === cute) return go\_on\_date

Triple equals implies JavaScript which uses camelCase, not üêç
