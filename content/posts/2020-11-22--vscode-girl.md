## VSCode

In order to be a VSCode Girl, you gotta [download VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and use it as your main IDE of course. What do you think I'm writing this blog post from?

Here are some extensions I love:

- [favorites](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=howardzuo.vscode-favorites): pin files/folders for easy access
- [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens): the best GitHub integration
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode): make sure you [format on save](https://scottsauber.com/2017/06/10/prettier-format-on-save-never-worry-about-formatting-javascript-again/)

## GitHub

Ah yes, the social media platform for brogrammers.

### Repos

### Pinned

### Commits

### Profile README

### Badges

## Personal/Portfolio Site

### Hinge

[Hinge](https://hinge.co/) is a great place to expand your personal brand's reach. You just gotta tailor your profile towards the average tech bro, slap your personal site link on it, and watch your SEO improve.

You think I'm kidding? This is the first prompt on my profile:

Just make sure you mention some other buzzwords in your profile (climbing, boba, Elon, Robinhood) and set your location to South Bay.

A side effect, whether you like it or not, is that you'll receive DMs like such:

> What's your favorite stack? Mine is me on top of you

Ugh gross ü§Æ

> Are you http? Because me without you is just ://

Pretty clever but are you insecure? Why not HTTPS smh

> Is this entire profile just an ad

Yes.

> // TODO: go on a date with [REDACTED]

I don't leave comments in my prod code oop

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
> if ([REDACTED] === cute) return go\_on\_date

Triple equals implies JavaScript which uses camelCase, not üêç

But remember, Hinge is not a dating app, it's merely a stepping stone (where you step on tech bros) for SEO. Do not get distracted.
