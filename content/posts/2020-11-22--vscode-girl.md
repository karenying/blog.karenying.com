I didn't coin the term "VSCode girl" but I'm here to teach you how to become one. It's a lifestyle, a mindset, not a stereotype.

We've emerged from the [sticky](https://support.apple.com/keyboard-service-program-for-mac-notebooks) depths of MacBook butterfly keyboards to oppose our archnemesis, the tech bros.

## VSCode

In order to be a VSCode Girl, you gotta [download VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and use it as your main IDE of course. What do you think I'm writing this blog post from?

Here are some extensions I love:

- [favorites](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=howardzuo.vscode-favorites): pin files/folders for easy access
- [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens): the best GitHub integration
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode): make sure you [format on save](https://scottsauber.com/2017/06/10/prettier-format-on-save-never-worry-about-formatting-javascript-again/)

## GitHub

Ah yes, the social media platform for brogrammers.

You need to become "the guy she tells me not to worry about".

### Repos

Start putting all your coding projects on GitHub. Version control and open source is great.

### Pinned

Pin your most starred/forked/favotire repos so that viewers can see them immediately.

### Commits

Coding for a school assignment? Great, make that repo private and still commit frequently to it. Make sure you turn on private contributions for your activity calendar:

You can keyboard smash as commits for private repos but you should probably have legit commit messages for your public ones.

> Commit to GitHub more than relationships.

Repeat this mantra over and over again. It's a central tenet of being a VSCode girl.

### Profile README

Recently, GitHub let users add a [profile README](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-your-profile-readme) that sits on top of the profile page.

People have gotten [real creative](https://towardsdatascience.com/build-a-stunning-readme-for-your-github-profile-9b80434fe5d7) with how to utilize this space. I opted for a [simpler approach](https://github.com/karenying) but you can really do whatever you want.

### PRO Badge

If you're a student, you get GitHub Pro for [free](https://education.github.com/pack).

Do I know what benefits I get for it? No. But does it look cool? Yes.

## Personal/Portfolio Site

Create a personal and/or portfolio site to show off your personality and your projects.

I bought my domain off [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/), built it with [React](https://reactjs.org/), and deployed it for free on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

Some blog posts I wrote to help with this:

- [Adding Transitions to a React Carousel with Material-UI](https://www.blog.karenying.com/posts/adding-transitions-to-a-react-carousel-with-material-ui)
- [404: React Page Not Found](https://www.blog.karenying.com/posts/404-react-page-not-found)
- [Simple React Router Nav Bar](https://www.blog.karenying.com/posts/nav-bar-with-dots)

Link your site EVERYWHERE. GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and yes even your Hinge.

### Hinge

[Hinge](https://hinge.co/) is a great place to expand your personal brand's reach. You just gotta tailor your profile towards the average tech bro, slap your personal site link on it, and watch your SEO improve.

You think I'm kidding? This is the first prompt on my profile:

![](/media/vscode-girl/hinge.jpg)

Make sure you mention some other buzzwords in your profile (climbing, boba, Elon, Robinhood) and set your location to South Bay.

A side effect, whether you like it or not, is that you'll receive DMs like such:

> What's your favorite stack? Mine is me on top of you

Ugh gross ü§Æ

> Are you http? Because me without you is just ://

Pretty clever but are you insecure? Why not HTTPS smh

> Is this entire profile just an ad

Yes.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
> if ([REDACTED] === cute) return go\_on\_date

Triple equals implies JavaScript which uses camelCase, not üêç

But remember, Hinge is not a dating app, it's merely a stepping stone (where you step on tech bros) for SEO. Do not get distracted.

## Blog

You can start by writing on [Medium](https://medium.com/). It's free with low barriers to entry.

If you want to take it to the next level, you can code your own blogging site. This site was bootstrapped with [Lumen](https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen), a lightweight [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) blog starter. It is statically hosted on [Netlify](http://netlify.com/).

## LinkedIn

To have a successful LinkedIn, you need a couple of things:

- A clean semi-professional headshot
- A tasteful banner/cover image
- A succinct header
- Filled out details for every section

With these things in hand, pretty soon you'll have an army of LinkedIn simps. Hint: they're useful for promoting your blog posts.

## Twitter

Tech Twitter is a weird but fun place.

Tweet your blogs, your opions, tear down tech bros' shitty code if they share a screenshot. You should tweet as if you had millions of followers. Fake it till you make it, right?

## Conclusion

In this post, I've outlined a couple of key steps to take to solidify your digital VSCode girl presence.
