If you‚Äôve seen a typical college student‚Äôs laptop, you might be familiar with [Momentum](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/momentum/laookkfknpbbblfpciffpaejjkokdgca?hl=en). This free Chrome extension _"replace[s] new tab page with a personal dashboard featuring to-do, weather, and inspiration"_.

However, after 5 years of looking at the same couple of pictures, motivational quotes, and the cheesy "What is your main focus for today?", I was long overdue for a change.

![Momentum ‚Äî no shade, just need to switch it up :)](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*tAyZKJwRHGTNjg5eFR2_uQ.jpeg)_Momentum ‚Äî no shade, just need to switch it up :)_

Thankfully, we can make our own personalized override of the Chrome homepage/new tab page. It‚Äôs fast, easy, and you can customize it however you want!

### Prereqs

This tutorial assumes you have some knowledge of Javascript and HTML/CSS. All good? Let‚Äôs get started üëçüèº

## Implementation

### 0. Getting Started

Much like how every npm project requires a `package.json`, every Chrome extension needs a manifest.json for important information. This file goes in the root directory. This is all we need initially:

`gist:karenying/be79110206415e17be3cfd7bb8881ed6/manifest-json`

Chrome [recommends](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/manifest/manifest_version) that developers put `2` for `manifest_version` so that‚Äôs what we‚Äôll do.

The last line is the crucial part, we‚Äôll be creating an `index.html` as our home page.

### ‚àû. Choose Your Own Adventure üåé

In the root directory, create an `index.html` file. Here‚Äôs a super bare bones template:

`gist:karenying/035a3ee24482972e0b9d4145b1bc72a7/index.html`

Make sure you fill out the `title` tag or you‚Äôll see an ugly "chrome://newtab".

Andddd that‚Äôs it! You‚Äôve just created an override of Chrome‚Äôs new tab page. Let‚Äôs make sure it works.

1. Go to `chrome://extensions` in the address bar

1. Turn "Developer Mode" on the top left

1. Click "Load unpack" and select the destination as this root directory

You should see it show up like so:

![Your new extension.](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*sBUJG2JPZmo_ismdOiw5_Q.png)_Your new extension._

Don‚Äôt worry if your ID is different!

Make sure that you‚Äôve turned Momentum off if you‚Äôve been using it. Now if you open a new tab or window, you should see the "Hello World!" from `index.html`.

That‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs that simple. If you know what you want yours to look like, seeya üëãüèº&nbsp;If you want to see how I made mine, stick around to add a clock, greeting, and date.

### 1. Add Clock

I knew I wanted to add a clock like Momentum. I really liked the idea of flip clocks to add some animation. After some googling, I found this [one](https://codepen.io/harshabhat86/full/tAxuF) by [Harsha Bhat](https://codepen.io/harshabhat86) on CodePen.

![[Flipping Clock](https://codepen.io/harshabhat86/full/tAxuF) by [Harsha Bhat](https://codepen.io/harshabhat86). Look familiar?](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*z7VWH20Euyi_KpulX2qtMg.png)_[Flipping Clock](https://codepen.io/harshabhat86/full/tAxuF) by [Harsha Bhat](https://codepen.io/harshabhat86). Look familiar?_

So I converted his Sass to an `index.css` , wrapped his JS in `DOMContentLoaded` event listener in a `script.js`, and linked the two new files and added `<div class="clock"></div>` to `index.html` üòÖ

You should check out his [code](https://codepen.io/harshabhat86/pen/tAxuF) if you‚Äôre interested in the nitty gritties, or see how I embedded it in my page in my GitHub [repo](https://github.com/karenying/chromepage).

I changed some of the CSS colors to fit my personal [site](http://karenying.com/) theme!

### 2. Add Greeting

Just the clock looked a bit bare. So I recreated Momentum‚Äôs greeting: "Good [timeframe], Karen".

All this takes is Javascript‚Äôs Date [API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date). In `index.html`, we add

```html
<p id="greeting">Good <span id="timeframe"></span>, Karen</p>
```

In `script.js`, we‚Äôll chain some `if` statements to determine what time of day it is:

`gist:karenying/fb0c0be4fb6c3d1e1b7b594b03d0bba8/script-js`

And we have ourselves a greeting!

### 3. Add Date

In a similar vein, we can add the current date:

`gist:karenying/74d0fb34737fa95a3e8b87d3cb30c8f5/index-html`

`gist:karenying/b89b52b168547d63a8cc56d6c4dc01e0/script-js`

With the help of the Date API, our page knows the current time, timeframe, and date!

This is how I went about personalizing my page. The GitHub [repo](https://github.com/karenying/chromepage) has more specific styling details. Many many thanks to [Harsha Bhat](https://codepen.io/harshabhat86) for his amazing clock.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to create a custom Chrome new tab page. You can get really creative. I merely gave some tips and suggestions on how to recreate mine üôÇ

My goal with this extension was to make my browsing experience feel more personalized and home-y. Hopefully, I‚Äôve helped you do the same! If anything, it‚Äôs quick, easy, and fun to build from scratch. If you got lost along the way, check out my GitHub [repo](https://github.com/karenying/chromepage). You can also install the version I made with the instructions in the repo `README`. Preview a live demo [here](https://karenying.github.io/chromepage/).
