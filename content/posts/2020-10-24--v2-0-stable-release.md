I picked up blogging on [Medium](https://medium.com/@karenying) over the summer out of boredom and [angst](http://localhost:8000/posts/let-2020-be-the-year-png-icons-die). It was an easy way to test to waters of blogging. However, with school and recruiting, I took a long break from pushing out content. It seemed like the longer I was away from writing, the harder it was to pick it back up again.

This past week, I decided that I will be returning to [Wellsheet](https://www.wellsheet.com/), a fast-paced healthcare startup based in NYC, as a full-time software engineer in Summer 2020! With that settled, I hacked together this blog site in the past couple of days.

I used the Gatsby Lumen [starter](https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen), creating only a couple of new components, and overriding much of the CSS. I wanted the theme to be completely dark-mode with pops of pastel color, echoing my personal/portfolio [site](https://www.karenying.com/) (they are sisters not twins!) I adore [Varela Round](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Varela+Round) (think grown-up Comic Sans) and [Ubuntu Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu+Mono) reflects the tech content. And I recognize that there is a thing as "too much color" -- to that I say ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

With the go-live of this site, I thought it would only be appropriate to give some context/introduce myself.

### About me

To new readers -- üëãüèº&nbsp;hi, I‚Äôm Karen. I‚Äôm currently a senior at Princeton University. I switched majors into Computer Science only about a year ago and since then it‚Äôs just been a deep dive into the world of web dev! You can view my portfolio [here](https://karenying.com/projects).

I enjoy frontend work and dabble in product/design. Blogging has been a fun outlet to explore those areas, while also helping me better articulate my thoughts/writing.

**Some (non-tech) things I‚Äôve gone semi-viral for**:

- [**100k views**] LinkedIn [post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kyying_internship-hiring-recruiting-activity-6661335912712060929-CO2b) about Vimeo cancelling my 2020 summer internship (worked out in the end though!)
- [**45k views**] APUSH YouTube [documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAKZhAXQEs0&ab_channel=KarenYing) (you know you made it when you get hate comments)
- [**14k views**] Tchaikovsky Sweet Dreams piano recital [performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGLcelRH4v4&ab_channel=ruanruijuan) at 7 y/o (yes, I played it too fast)
- [**200+ DMs**] SAD auction (iykyk üëÄ)

## Blogging

### Summer recap

Over the past 4 months, I‚Äôve amassed around 15k views over my 8 [Medium](https://medium.com/@karenying) articles. I mostly wrote web dev tutorials and UI/UX observational pieces.

My most popular posts are [Adding Transitions to a React Carousel with Material-UI](https://www.blog.karenying.com/posts/adding-transitions-to-a-react-carousel-with-material-ui) and [404: React Page Not Found](https://www.blog.karenying.com/posts/404-react-page-not-found). Most of these views come from Google (thank you SEO). My favorite post, however, is [50 Shades of Dark Mode Gray](https://www.blog.karenying.com/posts/50-shades-of-dark-mode-gray).

All of these posts have been imported onto this site. Medium will not be my main publishing platform anymore.

### Future content

I will continue to write about web dev/visual design. If you have any ideas for me to write about, or any feedback on my existing posts, please [email me](mailto:karenying7@gmail.com)! I would love to hear from you.

A subscriber email list _might_ be in the works -- stay tuned if you like what you‚Äôve read.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank Steven Chien, Reilly Bova, and Ali Alobaidi for being my biggest fans. I value your opinions so much and I know I‚Äôm really annoying when it comes to blogging :')

I also want to shoutout Victor Zhou for always being a blogging inspiration. His [blog](https://victorzhou.com/) is pretty great and you should definitely check it out!
