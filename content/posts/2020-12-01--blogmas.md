Welcome to Blogmas 2020 ðŸŽŠ

In the spirit of [Vlogmas](https://filmora.wondershare.com/family-n-personal/what-is-vlogmas.html), I decided to do Blogmas -- a megapost where I post everyday about something I coded or learned that day.

I'll be tackling side project improvements (including the blog!), exploring new technologies, and building potentially useless things. My [GitHub](https://github.com/karenying) contributions graph is not ready.

## 12/1: Bash alias for ISO 8601 formatted time

The [frontmatter](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/adding-markdown-pages/#frontmatter-for-metadata-in-markdown-files) of every blog post requires a timestamp to display on the post and feed. The [Lumen starter](https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen) that I used had the timestamp formatted in [ISO 8601](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime):

```yaml
date: '2017-08-18T22:12:03.284Z'
```

The `Z` at the end means that the timezone is UTC -- Coordinated Universal Time.

Initially, I was lazy and kept the time as is, only changing the date. Then I decided I wanted the date AND time to accurately reflect when I posted. I would Google "UTC time now" -- for some reason I thought this was more efficient than figuring out one time how to account for timezone in ISO 8601.

Thus, I'm finally creating a bash alias called `iso_date` that returns an ISO 8601 date for my frontmatter.

**Side note**: I also recently [transitioned](https://github.com/karenying/blog.karenying.com/commit/b8a126413d116d5bd1cc9ecbe45339a35742486b) from using [Moment](https://momentjs.com/) to [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/) and am using `fromISO` to [parse](https://moment.github.io/luxon/docs/class/src/datetime.js~DateTime.html#static-method-fromISO) the frontmatter date.

Bash has a [built in](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/unix-linux-bash-get-time/) `date` command with field descriptors. With this, we can create our bash alias. We need `%Y`, `%m`, `%d`, `%H`, `%M`, `%S`, and `%z`.

We want our string to look like `%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z`. And if we run `date +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z` it should work as expected:

### Save the command

Open `.bash_profile`:

```bash
vim ~/.bash_profile
```

add the alias:

```bash
alias iso_date="date +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z"
```

Restart the terminal and yay no more Googling UTC time!
