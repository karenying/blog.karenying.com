Welcome to Blogmas 2020 🎊

In the spirit of [Vlogmas](https://filmora.wondershare.com/family-n-personal/what-is-vlogmas.html), I'm participating in Blogmas -- this megapost where I blog daily about something I coded or learned that day.

I'll be tackling side project improvements (including this blog!), exploring new technologies, and building potentially useless things. My [GitHub](https://github.com/karenying) contributions graph and [free-tier](https://www.netlify.com/pricing/) [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) build minutes are not ready (I [enabled](https://github.com/karenying/blog.karenying.com/commit/9b70c026a33fd71a4a6613ac919abd87ef077928) [Gatsby incremental builds](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/23/enable-gatsby-incremental-builds-on-netlify/) for this).

## ⚙️ **12/1**: Bash alias for ISO 8601 formatted time

The [frontmatter](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/adding-markdown-pages/#frontmatter-for-metadata-in-markdown-files) of every blog post requires a timestamp to display on the post and feed. The [Lumen starter](https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen) that I used had the timestamp formatted in [ISO 8601](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime):

```yaml
date: '2017-08-18T22:12:03.284Z'
```

The `Z` at the end means that the timezone is UTC -- Coordinated Universal Time.

Initially, I was lazy and kept the time as is, only changing the date. Then I decided I wanted the date AND time to accurately reflect when I posted. I would Google "UTC time now" and fill in the details manually -- for some reason I thought this was more efficient than one time figuring out how to account for timezone in ISO 8601.

Thus, I'm finally creating a bash alias called `iso_date` that returns an ISO 8601 date for my frontmatter.

**Side note**: I recently [transitioned](https://github.com/karenying/blog.karenying.com/commit/b8a126413d116d5bd1cc9ecbe45339a35742486b) from using [Moment](https://momentjs.com/) to [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/) and am using `fromISO` to [parse](https://moment.github.io/luxon/docs/class/src/datetime.js~DateTime.html#static-method-fromISO) the frontmatter date.

Bash has a [built in](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/unix-linux-bash-get-time/) `date` command with field descriptors. With this, we can create our bash alias. We need `%Y`, `%m`, `%d`, `%H`, `%M`, `%S`, and `%z`.

We want our string to look like `%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z`. This returns the time in your current timezone which is more readable IMO. It should work as expected:

```bash
$ date +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z
2020-12-01T08:11:10-0500
```

### Save the command

Open `.bash_profile`:

```bash
vim ~/.bash_profile
```

add the alias:

```bash
// Header: .bash_profile
alias iso_date="date +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z"
```

Restart the terminal and yay no more Googling UTC time!

## 🎨 **12/2**: Animate SVG hamburger menu to X

I've always wanted to make a cool SVG animation. The classic example is smoothly animating a hamburger menu to a close icon:

<div class="blogmas-menu">
  <svg width="100" height="100" viewBox="0 0 100 100">
    <path class="line top" d="M 20,30 H 80"/>
    <path class="line middle" d="M 20,50 H 80" />
    <path class="line bottom" d="M 20,70 H 80"/>
  </svg>
  Hover over me!
</div>

I referenced these two CodePens as inspiration/help:

- [Hamburger Menu](https://codepen.io/ainalem/pen/wvKOEMV) by [Mikael Ainalem](https://codepen.io/ainalem)
- [Pure CSS hamburger icons transition](https://codepen.io/tonkec/pen/XXgdoo) by [Antonija Šimić](https://codepen.io/tonkec)

### Implementation

The skeleton HTML SVG code:

```html
// Header: index.html
<svg width="100" height="100" viewBox="0 0 100 100">
  <path class="line top" d="M 20,30 H 80" />
  <path class="line middle" d="M 20,50 H 80" />
  <path class="line bottom" d="M 20,70 H 80" />
</svg>
```

`<path>` elements draw the lines based on `M` (move to `x, y`) and `H` (horizontal line to `x`). So this snippet draws three horizontal lines.

And we'll define some CSS for these lines:

```css
// Header: index.css
.line {
  stroke-width: 6;
  stroke-linecap: round;
  stroke: #8deaff;
  transition: all 500ms;
}
```

- `stroke-width` determines how thicc the lines are
- `stroke-linecap` changes the ends of the lines to round
  - **Side note**: `stroke-linecap: butt` is the [default value](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/s/stroke-linecap/#values) 🍑
- `stroke` sets the color
- `transition` is normal CSS -- we want all the transitions to occur over half a second

Now, we use more CSS to animate the lines on hover via class selectors. Specifically, we want the top and bottom lines to rotate 45 degrees about their left ends and we want the middle line to disappear.

For the top and bottom lines we need to set their `transform-origin` initially:

```css
// Header: index.css
.top {
  transform-origin: 26px 40px;
}

.bottom {
  transform-origin: 26px 60px;
}
```

I had to play around with `transform-origin` to get them to rotate as expected.

And for the middle bar:

```css
// Header: index.css
.middle {
  stroke-dasharray: 60 60;
}
```

We initialize the line to have 60 dashes. In order for the initial appearance to look gapless, we display all 60 dashes. When we transform, we'll only show one dash.

CSS for the hover effects:

```css
// Header: index.css
.menu:hover .line {
  stroke: #ff7c7c;
}

.menu:hover .top {
  transform: rotate(45deg);
}

.menu:hover .middle {
  stroke-dasharray: 1 60;
  stroke-dashoffset: -30;
}

.menu:hover .bottom {
  transform: rotate(-45deg);
}
```

Every line changes color, we rotate top and bottom, and reduce the middle line to one dash while moving it to the middle!

See my [CodePen](https://codepen.io/karenying/pen/MWjwzMo) and [GitHub repo](https://github.com/karenying/menu-to-x-animation).

## ⚙️ **12/3**: VSCode snippets

I looked into [VSCode snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets) today and made my own to help speed up React development in particular.

### Empty function component: `comp`

**Snippet**:

```json
{
  "react functional component": {
    "scope": "javascript",
    "prefix": "comp",
    "body": ["const $1 = ({ $2 }) => {", "", "\treturn (", "", "\t)", "}"]
  }
}
```

**Output**:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```jsx
const /* 1st cursor */ = ({ /* 2nd cursor */ }) => {

  return (

  )
}
```

### useEffect hook: `useE`

**Snippet**:

```json
{
  "useEffect hook": {
    "scope": "javascript, typescript, javascriptreact, typescriptreact",
    "prefix": "useE",
    "body": ["useEffect(() => {", "\t$1", "})"]
  }
}
```

**Output**:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  /* CURSOR */
})
```

### useState hook: `useS`

**Snippet**:

```json
{
  "useState hook": {
    "scope": "javascript, typescript, javascriptreact, typescriptreact",
    "prefix": "useS",
    "body": ["const [$1, $2] = useState($3);$0"]
  }
}
```

**Output**:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```jsx
const [/* 1st */, /* 2nd */] = useState(/* 3rd */);
```

### ClassName: `cla`

**Snippet**:

```json
{
  "className": {
    "scope": "javascript, typescript, javascriptreact, typescriptreact",
    "prefix": "cla",
    "body": ["className=\"$1\""]
  }
}
```

**Output**:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```jsx
className="[CURSOR]"
```

## 📚 **12/4**: Leetcoding in Julia

**Confession time**: I got to name my sister and I named her Julia. I think I told my parents I picked it because I thought it was a pretty name. But actually, I named her after this girl I hated in preschool. See, I was upset that my sister's birth meant that we couldn't go to Disney World because she was too young. So I did the pettiest thing a 4 y/o could think of 😈

Anyways, I thought I'd try out the language that has been coined "the next Python", [Julia](https://julialang.org/). What better way to learn a new language than to solve the classic [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problem, [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/), with it?

I'm too lazy to configure the environment so I'm using an [online IDE](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_julia_online.php) instead.

Here's my solution:

```julia
// Header: main.jl
function twosum(nums, target)
  d = Dict()

  for i in eachindex(nums)
    if haskey(d, (target - nums[i]))
      return [d[target - nums[i]], i]
    else
      d[nums[i]] = i
    end
  end
end

@show twosum([2,7,11,15], 9)
```

Running it, we get:

```bash
$julia main.jl
twosum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9) = [1, 2]
```

### Initial comments

- The syntax strikes me as a mix between Python and Ruby
- Arrays and dictionaries operate as expected -- except it's **1-BASED INDEXING**
- `@show` [macro](https://riptutorial.com/julia-lang/example/6355/reimplementing-the--show-macro) is cool

### Overall thoughts

Julia was designed for performance in mind which is always _s e x y_. While my solution is untyped, Julia is dynamically typed. We also love being ~flexy~. BUT the one thing I can't get on board with is 1-based indexing 🤮 All in all impressed, I like it, and excited to see more mainstream usage!

## ⚙️ **12/5**: Auto generate Prettier config

[Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) is one of my favorite VSCode extensions. I like creating a Prettier config for every project based on the same template and tweak it slightly depending on the proj. I found myself copy and pasting the same `.prettierrc` file every time which is pure nonsense.

Thus I wrote a bash script to generate the template:

```bash
// Header: prettier.sh
#!/bin/bash

cat > .prettierrc << "EOF"
{
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "singleQuote": true,
  "jsxSingleQuote": true,
  "semi": true,
  "trailingComma": "es5",
  "bracketSpacing": true,
  "jsxBracketSameLine": false,
  "arrowParens": "always",
  "printWidth": 80
}
EOF
```

And added a bash alias:

```bash
// Header: .bash_profile
alias pret="sh ~/Documents/Projects/prettier.sh"
```

Now all I have to do is type `pret` in my terminal!

## 📚 **12/6**: Slack logo with CSS Grid

As someone who's been team [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/), I wanted to see what's up with all the hype around [Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/).

The Slack logo fits exactly in a 4 x 4 grid so we're gonna recreate it with divs (please never make your logo and put it on your site as divs omg).

![slack logo](/media/blogmas/slack-logo.png)

For our grid container, we'll declare each cell to be `50px` big and the gap between to be `12px`:

```css
// Header: index.css
.grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 50px 50px 50px 50px;
  grid-template-rows: 50px 50px 50px 50px;
  grid-gap: 12px;
}
```

Now we can fill in with our divs:

```html
// Header: index.html
<div class="grid">
  <div class="blue a"></div>
  <div class="blue b"></div>
  <div class="green a"></div>
  <div class="green b"></div>
  <div class="yellow a"></div>
  <div class="yellow b"></div>
  <div class="red a"></div>
  <div class="red b"></div>
</div>
```

Each div has a color class name as well as `a` if it's one-celled, or `b` if it takes up two cells.

Let's look at the CSS for the blue section:

```css
// Header: index.css
.blue.a {
  grid-column: 2;
  grid-row: 1;
}

.blue.b {
  grid-column: 1 / 3;
  grid-row: 2;
}
```

`.blue.a` only takes up one cell, so we only need to declare its row and column which are `1` and `2` respectively (Grid is 1-indexed):

![slack](/media/blogmas/slack-grid.png#width=300px)

`.blue.b` is in the 2nd row so we put `2` for that. Then for `column`, we use `start / finish` (the div extends _up to_ `finish`). `.blue.b` starts at column 1 and ends right before column 3 which gives us `1 / 3`.

We can fill out the rest of the colors by examining which cells they lie in. I also added more CSS to configure the colors and rounded borders. You can see the demo on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/karenying/pen/gOwPZYZ) and the full code on [GitHub](https://github.com/karenying/css-grid-slack-logo).

Our finished product is pretty close:

![slack](/media/blogmas/slack.png)

### Overall thoughts

Grid is pretty easy to use! It definitely has a ton of other features that I didn't explore in this simple build. It makes sense to use it for 2D layouts instead of just nesting Flexbox (@me oops). I bet I will frequent CSS-Tricks' [Grid guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) as I start to use Grid more often (the [Flexbox guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) has been a lifesaver).

## 🎨 **12/7**: Skeleton screens + New preview pic

I think skeleton screens are so cute -- I made one for the desktop view of this site's homepage:

![skeleton](/media/blogmas/skeleton.png)_Peep Figma [file](https://www.figma.com/file/Lsc48j3IOX6mHODbjR3tq8/skeleton-frame?node-id=0%3A1)_

In practice, perhaps only the right side (posts) would be abstracted but I just wanted to simplify as much as possible. And since my site is static, this wouldn't really be applicable anyways 😛

Skeleton screens, especially with left to right motion animations, make the load time seem faster. I read about them more in depth [here](https://uxdesign.cc/what-you-should-know-about-skeleton-screens-a820c45a571a). Thinking about animating a skeleton screen as a future blogmas post!\*

Btw, I changed this site's preview pic to a variation of the above skeleton screen:
![preview](/media/blogmas/preview.png)

She cute, she cute af. I'm obsessed 🥰 (the old preview was the cover image of my <a href="/posts/v2-0-stable-release" target="_blank">v2.0 Stable Release post</a>).

\***Update**: Just merged a PR for [work](https://www.wellsheet.com/) that animated a skeleton screen for a loading state! I lifted code from this [CodePen](https://codepen.io/viktorstrate/pen/yoBRLy).

## 📚 **12/8**: Intro to neural networks

Hi, my name is Karen and I'm allergic to React class components, supporting IE 11, infra dev, and ... oh yeah, mAcHiNe LeArNiNg.

I'm challenging the last one by doing [Victor Zhou](http://victorzhou.com/)'s top post/tutorial -- [Machine Learning for Beginners: An Introduction to Neural Networks](https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-neural-networks/). I dropped Princeton's ELE 435: Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition, after the midterm so this should be interesting.

Let's do it!

1. **Building Blocks: Neurons**
   - Ya makes sense
   - **Side note**: I thought NumPy was pronounced "num-pee" until someone told me it's Numerical Python not Numerical Pee-thon
2. **Combining Neurons into a Neural Network**
   - Mmm we good
3. **Training a Neural Network, Part 1**
   - Still following but MSE is giving me PTSD to my [ORFE](https://orfe.princeton.edu/home) days
4. **Training a Neural Network, Part 2**
   - Alright I was doing okay until we got to the multi part, and then my eyes glazed over 🙄
   - Well I trust the math/code and SGD makes sense on a high level

### Overall thoughts

The tutorial opens with:

> This post is intended for complete beginners and assumes ZERO prior knowledge of machine learning.

And I mean ya dat me and it was easy enough to follow -- I enjoyed how well-structured it was with the diagrams, tables, code blocks etc.

However, I still feel the same way towards ML -- not really interested in the theory/math behind it because it's a bunch of icky calc and lin alg. Maybe I'd be more interested in the applications (`import sklearn` amiright). But then again, applying ML = training model, waiting for results, tweaking params, repeat ... soooooo I think I'll just stick to web dev.

## 🤔 **12/9**: Spotify Wrapped design analysis

_Written while listening to my [Top Songs 2020 playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1EMaba5daAs6pY?si=wFKQvUuVT7m7rKz6UlG0BQ)_

I read this [article](https://medium.com/throughdesign/spotify-2019-wrapped-a-design-masterstroke-1d06b27b0aec) around this time last year about Spotify Wrapped 2019's UI/UX design. Here's my take on this year's.

Spotify Wrapped is the most simple form of data viz. It shows that the app can do `+=1`, yay! Yet people still eat it up because of its nice UI along with how personal and immersive the experience feels.

We'll start off with the 4 basic colors Spotify used:

![wrapped palette](/media/blogmas/wrapped-palette.png)_Spotify Wrapped 2020 palette created with [Coolors](https://coolors.co/)_

I've written about this [before](https://blog.karenying.com/posts/50-shades-of-dark-mode-gray#spotify-macos-app) -- Spotify's dark-mode only UI allows for colorful album art to pop, just like how theaters dim their lights for shows. Thus, these 4 bright colors especially stand out amongst the darker backgrounds. You can see the same effect on _this_ site.

![wrapped banner](/media/blogmas/wrapped-banner.PNG#width=300px)

With these 4 colors, Spotify only uses 2 pairings throughout the story -- dark blue with green, and pink with cyan. These pairings have relatively high [contrast ratios](https://blog.karenying.com/posts/boost-visual-accessibility-by-auto-flipping-text-color#wcag-and-contrast-ratio) which increases text legibility (light green with cyan would be too hard to read). Here's an example of the dark pink on cyan:

![wrapped cover](/media/blogmas/wrapped-cover.PNG#width=300px)

In addition to this fixed color palette, Spotify also uses a rainbow-ish gradient as a common theme. This vertical gradient features the dark blue, cyan, and green from the palette, as well as black and warmer sunset-like hues. It appears primarily as a background, with the other 4 colors in the foreground. The gradient is also animated in the story. Its vertical movement gives more depth and a sense of momentum, allowing the data to seem more interesting.

You would think that this combo of colors from all across the spectrum would clash. However IMO, the gradient really ties the contrasting colors together. You end up with a sort of tropical / beachy / summery vibe.

These bright colors, along with uplifting comments such as:

> Even in 2020, you still found ways to grow

> You're a pioneer

make you reflect on your year of music with a positive attitude. And that's their goal -- they want you to like this recap so much that you share it with friends and on social media (if you didn't IG story it, did you even listen to music?). Spotify's stock [soared](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/spotify-stock-jumps-wrapped-report-joe-rogan-exclusivity/) because of this Wrapped hype. Clearly they have found a winning marketing/branding strat.

Well here's my 2020 Spotify Wrapped:

![my wrapped](/media/blogmas/wrapped-me.JPG#width=300px)

Just a girl who likes to beep boop while listening to beep boop music!

## 🎨 **12/10**: GitHub Wrapped

Amidst all this end of the year recap hype, I designed a GitHub Wrapped:

![GitHub Wrapped](/media/blogmas/github_wrapped.png)_Peep Figma [file](https://www.figma.com/file/8p6E29dFwAkosTTAgrQR0O/github-wrapped?node-id=0%3A1)_

2020 was definitely a big coding year for me! I switched my major to CS at the end of 2019, so this year has just been me diving into the world of web dev. I worked on some full stack stuff and realized I definitely have a pref for frontend and an interest in product / design.

GitHub was at the center of all this -- it's my most visited page on Chrome. At this point, I'd think it's hot if someone [named a branch](https://twitter.com/lil_morgy/status/1291871226936221697) after me 🥺

## 🎨 **12/11**: Back to top button (1)

_Implemented an hour before my **first** final exam_

This Blogmas post is getting obscenely long so I created a back to top button that hangs around the bottom right corner of posts.

I decided on an upwards chevron from [Ionicons](https://ionicons.com/) but I'm using it through [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/search?q=arrow). **Side note**: At some point I wanna stop using React Icons and just import the SVGs but I'm lazy.

This is the design I settled on for mobile:

![back to top button](/media/blogmas/backtotop.png#width=300px)

The mobile button is different from the desktop version. I toyed with just having the icon have the shadow, but I felt like it didn't stand out enough on mobile because it was on top of white text. The desktop version is just the chevron to the right of the text, completely flat. The desktop icon has a shadow on hover (not the entire button). This is consistent with the home button in the top left corner.

### Implementation

All the CSS isn't very interesting -- except that of course it's `position: fixed` and I had to use `calc` for the desktop version to ensure that it was the right distance from the middle content.

Adding the back to top click handler wasn't hard either:

```jsx
const scrollToTop = () => {
  window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' });
};

<div onClick={scrollToTop} />;
```

`scroll-behavior: smooth` has [better browser compatibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-behavior) than `window.scrollTo` but I couldn't get it to work 😞

A trickier thing was getting the button to hide when the user is scrolling. This is for mobile only. I tested it on desktop but it seemed unnecessary since the button wasn't over text. This is what I ended up doing:

```jsx
const [opacity, setOpacity] = useState(1);

useEffect(() => {
  let timeoutID;
  const onScroll = () => {
    setOpacity(0);
    clearTimeout(timeoutID);

    timeoutID = setTimeout(() => {
      setOpacity(1);
    }, 100);
  };

  window.addEventListener('scroll', onScroll);

  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener('scroll', onScroll);
    clearTimeout(timeoutID);
  };
}, []);

<div onClick={scrollToTop} style={{ opacity }} />;
```

with a `transition: opacity 100ms` property for the div.

**Let's break this down**:

- First, we define the opacity of the button as a state variable and set it with in-line styling
- On mount, we add an event listener for scrolling -- `onScroll` is called every time the user scrolls
- Immediately after detecting scrolling, we set the opacity of the div to `0` (I chose opacity instead of `display: none` because we can't use `transition` on `display`)
- We clear the previous timer and set a new one for 100ms
- After 100ms, if a new scroll hasn't been detected, then the div's opacity is restored to `1`
- On unmount, we remove the scroll listener and clean up the timeout

Another way I could have done this is using refs:

```jsx
const scrollRef = useRef();

useEffect(() => {
  let timeoutID;
  const onScroll = () => {
    scrollRef.current.style.opacity = 0;
    clearTimeout(timeoutID);

    timeoutID = setTimeout(() => {
      scrollRef.current.style.opacity = 1;
    }, 100);
  };
}, []);

<div onClick={scrollToTop} ref={scrollRef} />;
```

While the using a state variable triggers a rerender every time and using refs does not, the first implementation is considered the "correct" React way. It's [declarative](https://fjorgedigital.com/insights/blog/the-philosophy-of-react-declarative-rendering/) -- in the first case, it _declares_ what the opacity should be and the state variable _reacts_ to change the CSS. The second method directly (imperatively) sets the opacity with `ref.current`.

Either way, I'm happy with how it turned out!\*

\***Update**: Was not happy with how it turned out and hence this next post 😡

## ⚙️ **12/12**: Back to top button (2)

_Implemented an hour before my **second** final exam_

Hiding the back to top button on every scroll was a lil distracting even on mobile. Instead, I want it to be hidden if the user is scrolling _down_, but visible if the user scrolls _up_. I'm also making the home button appear at the top simultaneously.

Here's what they look like (you should be able to see on mobile!):

![new back to top button](/media/blogmas/home_button.jpg#width=300px)

![home button](/media/blogmas/new_backtotop.jpg#width=300px)

I added a border to both because they weren't very visible without.

### Implementation

Like the resourceful dev that I am, I basically stole the code from this [Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62497110/detect-scroll-direction-in-react-js/62497293#62497293) 😀

I replaced the previous scroll handler with this:

```jsx
const [isScrollingUp, setScrollDir] = useState(false);

useEffect(() => {
  const minShowThreshold = 812;
  let lastScrollY = window.pageYOffset;
  let isScrolling = true;
  let requestID;

  const updateScrollDir = () => {
    const scrollY = window.pageYOffset;

    setScrollDir(scrollY > minShowThreshold && scrollY < lastScrollY);
    lastScrollY = scrollY;
    isScrolling = true;
  };

  const onScroll = () => {
    if (isScrolling) {
      requestID = window.requestAnimationFrame(updateScrollDir);
      isScrolling = false;
    }
  };

  window.addEventListener('scroll', onScroll);

  return () => {
    cancelAnimationFrame(requestID);
    window.removeEventListener('scroll', onScroll);
  };
}, []);
```

And a separate `useEffect` handles the opacity:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  setOpacity(isScrollingUp ? 1 : 0);
}, [isScrollingUp]);
```

**Side note**: I remember being shook that you could have multiple `useEffects` in the same component, each with different dependencies 🤯

**Let's break this down**:

- While scrolling, we keep the old position, and check if the new position is higher than the old. If it is, then we set `isScrollingUp` as true
- I set a `minShowThreshold` of `812px` so that when the user is close to the top of the page, the buttons wouldn't show even if they are scrolling up
- `isScrolling` makes sure that `updateScrollDir` is only called once per repaint. The code works without the `requestAnimationFrame` business. It's basically just acting as throttling so I guess I'll keep it
- In a separate `useEffect`, I set the opacity of the buttons based on `isScrollingUp`

This is hopefully the last part of the back to top saga!

## ⚙️ **12/13**: Gatsby plugin to calculate reading time

_Implemented before my **third** and **fourth** (last!) finals and written after_

Yay we're officially more than halfway through Blogmas and done with fall semester 🎉

Before, I calculated time read by legit copy and pasting a post into a Medium draft and stealing their calculation (or just taking it if the post was already on Medium). I had a `minutes` field in the frontmatter of every post and would query it.

Instead of this jank approach, I'm using the `gatsby-remark-reading-time` [plugin](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-remark-reading-time-v2/). I followed the installation instructions and it worked without any hiccups.\* Now I don't have to manually update the frontmatter after every Blogmas minipost!

This plugin uses the `reading-time` [package](https://github.com/ngryman/reading-time). I [peeped](https://github.com/ngryman/reading-time/blob/master/lib/reading-time.js) at how it calculates number of minutes. It seems like it doesn't count images like [Medium does](https://blog.medium.com/read-time-and-you-bc2048ab620c).

Here are the posts where there's a difference in calculated reading time between Medium and this plugin:

| Post                                                                                                                                                              | Medium | `reading-time` |

We can see that **images** increase Medium's calculated time, whereas **codeblocks** increase the plugin's (on Medium I embedded GitHub gists).

Which one is more accurate? 🤷🏻‍♀️

\***Update**: UmmMMMmMmMm this plugin has a race condition I swear so I'm reverting back to my old ways of just relying on Medium. I would click a post or next page and sometimes nothing would render until I refreshed. The console would say that the `readingTime` was undefined in the GraphQL query which would cause the page to crash. Maybe I set it up wrong? Idk I'll have to investigate more

## 🤔 **12/14**: GitHub dark mode is too dark

Today's minipost ended up being its own [post](https://blog.karenying.com/posts/github-darkmode-sucks).\* Back to our regularly scheduled programming (wow accidental pun) tomorrow!

\***Update**: I'm currently 2 days ahead of Blogmas which explains this timestamp -- On 12/12, [GitHub Dark Mode is Too Dark](https://blog.karenying.com/posts/github-darkmode-sucks) peaked at [#2](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25400139) on the front page of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) 😮

## 📚 **12/15**: styled-components

I've always wanted to try [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)! Today I followed the Getting Started [tutorial](https://styled-components.com/#your-first-styled-component) on their homepage.

They show us how to create a button and a primary variation of it:

```jsx
// Header: Button.js
import styled, { css } from 'styled-components';

const Button = styled.button`
  background: transparent;
  border-radius: 3px;
  border: 2px solid palevioletred;
  color: palevioletred;
  margin: 0.5em 1em;
  padding: 0.25em 1em;

  ${(props) =>
    props.primary &&
    css`
      background: palevioletred;
      color: white;
    `}
`;
```

**Side note**: I had to brush up on [tagged templates](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#Tagged_templates).

And we use it as we'd expect with an optional `primary` prop:

```jsx
// Header: App.js
<Button>Normal Button</Button>
<Button primary>Primary Button</Button>
```

I created the same button with my own component + [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) to compare:

```jsx
// Header: Button.js
const Button = (props) => {
  const { primary, children } = props;

  const className = primary ? 'Button primary' : 'Button';

  return <button className={className}>{children}</button>;
};
```

```scss
// Header: Button.scss
.Button {
  background: transparent;
  border-radius: 3px;
  border: 2px solid palevioletred;
  color: palevioletred;
  margin: 0.5em 1em;
  padding: 0.25em 1em;

  .primary {
    background: palevioletred;
    color: white;
  }
}
```

With styled-components, we skip the step of creating the React component -- plug in some CSS and it just works out of the box. Pretty cool.

### Overall thoughts

I dabbled with having CSS in React files with [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/styles/basics/). And I have the same mixed feels with that as I do with styled-components.

Perhaps it's just the way I learned web dev but I really like separating styling and "business logic". However, I can see why for something reusable / versatile like a button, styled-components makes sense -- especially since it takes out the middleman of creating a React component.

I also noticed was that when I inspect element on a styled-components element, the class names aren't semantic. For example I saw `class="sc-bdfBwQ bGgqpE"`. Often times I use the class name to locate an element in the code base. Not sure what I would do in this case.

Anyways, while styled-components is something I'm definitely not used to, it has made me want to keep an open mind! It really does feel like a more modern approach to styling.

## ⚙️ **12/16**: VSCode spell check

https://twitter.com/Taytus/status/1338231886980796419

Finally got around to installing a spell check extension in VSCode. Before I would catch typos by copying and pasting into a Google Doc. Yep, not proud of that one.

I installed [Spell Right](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ban.spellright) and changed the typo notification color from "error" to "information". The red from error was way too jarring and made me think my markdown doesn't compile (which isn't really a thing?). Now typos show up as a nice unoffensive light blue so I'm a fan! I also configured the extension to run only on markdown files.

Here's what was added to my global `settings.json`:

```json
// Header: settings.json
"spellright.notificationClass": "information",
"spellright.documentTypes": ["markdown"]
```

Goodbye typos 👋🏼

## 🤔 **12/17**: Round profile pics

Most social media apps utilize round profile pictures instead of square ones nowadays. If you think back to just a couple of years ago, square pics were definitely more widely used. When did this change happen and why?

Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter switched to round propics around 2016 / 2017 and many apps followed suit. The reasoning is quite simple -- a circular image draws the eye more the center of a face than a square one. Round pics cut off the unnecessary busy borders which helps highlight faces.

We see very few sharp corners in real life, so it makes sense that roundness is popular in UI/UX design (try to spot a corner on this site). Sharp edges on websites make me a bit uncomfy. Round corners are so much friendlier!

## 📚 **12/18**: React Native

As a frontend web dev, I've realized that responsiveness is the bane of my existence. But what about developing for mobile only? To answer that, I tried React Native.

I followed the official env setup [docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) and used [Expo CLI](https://expo.io/tools) to run my test app. It was all pretty smooth. I really liked the idea of scanning a QR code to run stuff on my phone directly. That's always more realistic than using an emulator.

First, I familiarized myself with the syntax. Here are some technical details I noticed right away compared with React:

- `View`s are the same as `div`s -- HTML elements aren't a thing in React Native. Instead, out of the box components are used (imported from `'react-native'`)
- CSS got replaced with `StyleSheet`s. It reminds me of the Material UI `makeStyles` [hook](https://material-ui.com/styles/basics/). Many styling properties are the same (there's still flex!). But [like with](#-1215-styled-components) `styled-components`, it seems like you can't really separate the styling from the JS
- `onClick` handler is called `onPress` -- pretty appropriate
- There's no "Inspect Element" that I know of which can make debugging difficult?

Then I played around with React Native's [Core Components and APIs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/components-and-apis). I was impressed with the amount of native (ha) components that exist and how robust they are. For example, the Modal [component](https://reactnative.dev/docs/modal) -- Something like this only exists with external libraries like [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) for React; Yet, it just comes with React Native (with animations too).

### Overall thoughts

I really really liked React Native. Idk why that would be a surprise since I'm a React girl at heart (I often joke about getting a React logo tat). Even though I hate keeping responsiveness in mind for web apps, I would probably like it a lot more if I was developing for mobile _only_.

There's so much less screen real estate. This means that minimalism and functionality are critical -- both things I'm into. Mobile also comes with more interactive features like long presses, swipes, vibrations etc. which are fun to consider.

All in all, I'm impressed with the dev experience and the existing Core Components. I think if I were to do more mobile only dev, I would enjoy its quirks. It's the same same but different as React!

## 🎨 **12/19**: karenying.com redesign (1)

I've been dying to get rid of the carousel on the projects page (even though I wrote a [tutorial](https://blog.karenying.com/posts/adding-transitions-to-a-react-carousel-with-material-ui) on it rip). It looks bad on mobile because the arrows take up precious width space. It's also just hard to click on things that are close to the edge of the screen. Instead, each project card will appear vertically stacked so that the user can scroll through them. On tablet, it'll be the mobile cards in a grid.

Introducing my proposed projects page designs with some CSS notes (peep the Figma [file](https://www.figma.com/file/y6LPfrHI1yzewrcdLBFVo6/karenying.com-redesign?node-id=0%3A1)):

**Desktop**
![web designs](/media/blogmas/karenying.com-web.png)

**Mobile**
![mobile designs](/media/blogmas/karenying.com-mobile.png)

I still struggled with incorporating the image in the mobile card. The shapes don't really work out? I toyed with the idea of having some kind of click / hover action but that seems unnecessary finicky.

This design change will bring the styling of karenying.com closer to that of this blog's. Hello Ubuntu Mono and Open Sans. I was also definitely influenced by the Blogmas calendar [visualizer](https://www.blogmas.karenying.com/). Each card will still have one of the four accent colors but it'll be more subtle.

Tomorrow's minipost will be about implementing this change! I'm hoping to move away from using Material UI for this and I'll be updating the page with some more recent projects.

## 🎨 **12/20**: karenying.com redesign (2)

Today I just implemented the redesign from the previous minipost. I'm happy with how it [turned out](https://karenying.com/projects).

In addition to being more stylistically similar to this blog site, the mobile experience is so much better:

![redesign comparison](/media/blogmas/karenying-comparison.png)

The purple outlines an iPhone 12 Mini's Chrome wrapper border. The carousel arrows are gone and I condensed the info into a shorter card. I also added a couple more projects. I put Blogmas on there so I had to create a cute graphic for it (now the new preview / cover pic of this post -- one at the very top). I like it so much 🥰

For tablet view, I ended up not doing a grid of cards -- the mobile cards are actually different heights, so it'd look a bit strange / I couldn't be bothered to style them for the grid. GAnalytics says that like 2% of my visitors are on tablet so...

It was definitely a challenge to sift through the code I wrote 7 months ago. It was also interesting to see how my design preferences have changed. Now, I feel like the old site's style as a tad too youthful / colorful haha. I set up a [preview](https://5fdd742bd1687a00089afc70--karen-ying.netlify.app/projects) of the old site that you can peep to compare.

Finally, I made a new preview graphic for karenying.com:

## ⚙️ **12/21**: Progressive image loader

I use the [React Progressive Image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-progressive-image) npm package on my [portfolio site](http://karenying.com/) to progressively load all the images.

Here's an example of it in action on my [home page](https://karenying.com/):

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```jsx
import ProgressiveImage from 'react-progressive-image';

import Karen from '../Assets/karen.png';
import MiniKaren from '../Assets/mini-karen.png';

<ProgressiveImage src={Karen} placeholder={MiniKaren}>
  {(src, loading) => (
    <img style={{ opacity: loading ? 0.8 : 1 }} src={src} alt='karen' />
  )}
</ProgressiveImage>
```

While it's easy to use, it has two main problems:

1. The placeholder image needs to be scaled either manually or with CSS, to the same dimensions as the source image. If you don't and use a smaller pic for the placeholder, you'll see a visually smaller pic while the original image loads. It's a bit trippy when the bigger image comes in because of the size difference
2. The component doesn't blur the placeholder image. So you have to filter the image beforehand with some 3rd party app

I implemented my own version that solves these issues.

Here's the component:

```jsx
// Header: ProgressiveImage.js
import { useState } from 'react';

import './ProgressiveImage.css';

const ProgressiveImage = ({ src, placeholder, width, height, alt }) => {
  const [opacity, setOpacity] = useState(1);

  return (
    <div
      className='ProgressiveImage'
      style={{ width: `${width}px`, height: `${height}px` }}
    >
      <img
        className='ProgressiveImage-mini'
        src={placeholder}
        style={{ opacity }}
        width={width}
        height={height}
        alt={alt}
      />
      <img
        className='ProgressiveImage-img'
        src={src}
        onLoad={() => setOpacity(0)}
        width={width}
        height={height}
        alt={alt}
      />
    </div>
  );
};

export default ProgressiveImage;
```

Some key implementations:

- It takes in `width` and `height` props so that the container and the two images can all be the same size
- The second image has an `onLoad` handler that sets the opacity of the first

And here's the corresponding CSS:

```CSS
// Header: ProgressiveImage.css

.ProgressiveImage {
  position: relative;
}

.ProgressiveImage-mini,
.ProgressiveImage-img {
  position: absolute;
}

.ProgressiveImage-mini {
  transition: opacity 150ms linear;
  -webkit-filter: blur(2px);
  filter: blur(2px);
}
```

Some key implementations:

- The placeholder image has a `transition` property for opacity. This allows the transition to the source image to be gradual
- I use a filter to blur the placeholder, hence solving issue #2
- The `position` properties allow the images to be on top of each other

And here it is in action:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```jsx
// Header: App.js
import Karen from './assets/karen.png'; // 1.1mb
import MiniKaren from './assets/mini-karen.png'; // 15kb

import ProgressiveImage from './components/ProgressiveImage/ProgressiveImage';

<ProgressiveImage
  src={Karen}
  placeholder={MiniKaren}
  width='200'
  height='200'
  alt='karen'
/>
```

Pretty simple, right?

I don't think I'll go back and replace React Progressive Image. I've already scaled and blurred my placeholder images haha but this was fun to implement!
