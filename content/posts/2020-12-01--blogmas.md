Welcome to Blogmas 2020 üéä

In the spirit of [Vlogmas](https://filmora.wondershare.com/family-n-personal/what-is-vlogmas.html), I'm participating in Blogmas -- this megapost where I blog daily about something I coded or learned that day.

I'll be tackling side project improvements (including this blog!), exploring new technologies, and building potentially useless things. My [GitHub](https://github.com/karenying) contributions graph and [free-tier](https://www.netlify.com/pricing/) [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) build minutes are not ready (I [enabled](https://github.com/karenying/blog.karenying.com/commit/9b70c026a33fd71a4a6613ac919abd87ef077928) [Gatsby incremental builds](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/23/enable-gatsby-incremental-builds-on-netlify/) for this).

## ‚öôÔ∏è **12/1**: Bash alias for ISO 8601 formatted time

The [frontmatter](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/adding-markdown-pages/#frontmatter-for-metadata-in-markdown-files) of every blog post requires a timestamp to display on the post and feed. The [Lumen starter](https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen) that I used had the timestamp formatted in [ISO 8601](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime):

```yaml
date: '2017-08-18T22:12:03.284Z'
```

The `Z` at the end means that the timezone is UTC -- Coordinated Universal Time.

Initially, I was lazy and kept the time as is, only changing the date. Then I decided I wanted the date AND time to accurately reflect when I posted. I would Google "UTC time now" and fill in the details manually -- for some reason I thought this was more efficient than one time figuring out how to account for timezone in ISO 8601.

Thus, I'm finally creating a bash alias called `iso_date` that returns an ISO 8601 date for my frontmatter.

**Side note**: I recently [transitioned](https://github.com/karenying/blog.karenying.com/commit/b8a126413d116d5bd1cc9ecbe45339a35742486b) from using [Moment](https://momentjs.com/) to [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/) and am using `fromISO` to [parse](https://moment.github.io/luxon/docs/class/src/datetime.js~DateTime.html#static-method-fromISO) the frontmatter date.

Bash has a [built in](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/unix-linux-bash-get-time/) `date` command with field descriptors. With this, we can create our bash alias. We need `%Y`, `%m`, `%d`, `%H`, `%M`, `%S`, and `%z`.

We want our string to look like `%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z`. This returns the time in your current timezone which is more readable IMO. It should work as expected:

```bash
$ date +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z
2020-12-01T08:11:10-0500
```

### Save the command

Open `.bash_profile`:

```bash
vim ~/.bash_profile
```

add the alias:

```bash
// Header: .bash_profile
alias iso_date="date +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z"
```

Restart the terminal and yay no more Googling UTC time!

## üé® **12/2**: Animate SVG hamburger menu to X

I've always wanted to make a cool SVG animation. The classic example is smoothly animating a hamburger menu to a close icon:

![animation](/media/blogmas/menu.gif#width=300px)<i><center>What I ended up creating. CodePen <a href="https://codepen.io/karenying/pen/MWjwzMo" target="_blank">here</a></center></i>

I referenced these two CodePens as inspiration/help:

- [Hamburger Menu](https://codepen.io/ainalem/pen/wvKOEMV) by [Mikael Ainalem](https://codepen.io/ainalem)
- [Pure CSS hamburger icons transition](https://codepen.io/tonkec/pen/XXgdoo) by [Antonija ≈†imiƒá](https://codepen.io/tonkec)

### Implementation

The skeleton HTML SVG code:

```html
// Header: index.html
<svg width="100" height="100" viewBox="0 0 100 100">
  <path class="line top" d="M 20,30 H 80" />
  <path class="line middle" d="M 20,50 H 80" />
  <path class="line bottom" d="M 20,70 H 80" />
</svg>
```

`<path>` elements draw the lines based on `M` (move to `x, y`) and `H` (horizontal line to `x`). So this snippet draws three horizontal lines.

And we'll define some CSS for these lines:

```css
// Header: index.css
.line {
  stroke-width: 6;
  stroke-linecap: round;
  stroke: #8deaff;
  transition: all 500ms;
}
```

- `stroke-width` determines how thicc the lines are
- `stroke-linecap` changes the ends of the lines to round
  - **Side note**: `stroke-linecap: butt` is the [default value](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/s/stroke-linecap/#values) üçë
- `stroke` sets the color
- `transition` is normal CSS -- we want all the transitions to occur over half a second

Now, we use more CSS to animate the lines on hover via class selectors. Specifically, we want the top and bottom lines to rotate 45 degrees about their left ends and we want the middle line to disappear.

For the top and bottom lines we need to set their `transform-origin` initially:

```css
// Header: index.css
.top {
  transform-origin: 26px 40px;
}

.bottom {
  transform-origin: 26px 60px;
}
```

I had to play around with `transform-origin` to get them to rotate as expected.

And for the middle bar:

```css
// Header: index.css
.middle {
  stroke-dasharray: 60 60;
}
```

We initialize the line to have 60 dashes. In order for the initial appearance to look gapless, we display all 60 dashes. When we transform, we'll only show one dash.

CSS for the hover effects:

```css
// Header: index.css
.menu:hover .line {
  stroke: #ff7c7c;
}

.menu:hover .top {
  transform: rotate(45deg);
}

.menu:hover .middle {
  stroke-dasharray: 1 60;
  stroke-dashoffset: -30;
}

.menu:hover .bottom {
  transform: rotate(-45deg);
}
```

Every line changes color, we rotate top and bottom, and reduce the middle line to one dash while moving it to the middle!

See my [CodePen](https://codepen.io/karenying/pen/MWjwzMo) and [GitHub repo](https://github.com/karenying/menu-to-x-animation).

## ‚öôÔ∏è **12/3**: VSCode snippets

I looked into [VSCode snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets) today and made my own to help speed up React development in particular.

### Empty function component: `comp`

**Snippet**:

```json
{
  "react functional component": {
    "scope": "javascript",
    "prefix": "comp",
    "body": ["const $1 = ({ $2 }) => {", "", "\treturn (", "", "\t)", "}"]
  }
}
```

**Output**:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```jsx
const /* 1st cursor */ = ({ /* 2nd cursor */ }) => {

  return (

  )
}
```

### useEffect hook: `useE`

**Snippet**:

```json
{
  "useEffect hook": {
    "scope": "javascript, typescript, javascriptreact, typescriptreact",
    "prefix": "useE",
    "body": ["useEffect(() => {", "\t$1", "})"]
  }
}
```

**Output**:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  /* CURSOR */
})
```

### useState hook: `useS`

**Snippet**:

```json
{
  "useState hook": {
    "scope": "javascript, typescript, javascriptreact, typescriptreact",
    "prefix": "useS",
    "body": ["const [$1, $2] = useState($3);$0"]
  }
}
```

**Output**:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```jsx
const [/* 1st */, /* 2nd */] = useState(/* 3rd */);
```

### ClassName: `cla`

**Snippet**:

```json
{
  "className": {
    "scope": "javascript, typescript, javascriptreact, typescriptreact",
    "prefix": "cla",
    "body": ["className=\"$1\""]
  }
}
```

**Output**:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```jsx
className="[CURSOR]"
```

## üìö **12/4**: Leetcoding in Julia

**Confession time**: I got to name my sister and I named her Julia. I think I told my parents I picked it because I thought it was a pretty name. But actually, I named her after this girl I hated in preschool. See, I was upset that my sister's birth meant that we couldn't go to Disney World because she was too young. So I did the pettiest thing a 4 y/o could think of üòà

Anyways, I thought I'd try out the language that has been coined "the next Python", [Julia](https://julialang.org/). What better way to learn a new language than to solve the classic [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problem, [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/), with it?

I'm too lazy to configure the environment so I'm using an [online IDE](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_julia_online.php) instead.

Here's my solution:

```julia
// Header: main.jl
function twosum(nums, target)
  d = Dict()

  for i in eachindex(nums)
    if haskey(d, (target - nums[i]))
      return [d[target - nums[i]], i]
    else
      d[nums[i]] = i
    end
  end
end

@show twosum([2,7,11,15], 9)
```

Running it, we get:

```bash
$julia main.jl
twosum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9) = [1, 2]
```

### Initial comments

- The syntax strikes me as a mix between Python and Ruby
- Arrays and dictionaries operate as expected -- except it's **1-BASED INDEXING**
- `@show` [macro](https://riptutorial.com/julia-lang/example/6355/reimplementing-the--show-macro) is cool

### Overall thoughts

Julia was designed for performance in mind which is always _s e x y_. While my solution is untyped, Julia is dynamically typed. We also love being ~flexy~. BUT the one thing I can't get on board with is 1-based indexing ü§Æ All in all impressed, I like it, and excited to see more mainstream usage!

## ‚öôÔ∏è **12/5**: Auto generate Prettier config

[Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) is one of my favorite VSCode extensions. I like creating a Prettier config for every project based on the same template and tweak it slightly depending on the proj. I found myself copy and pasting the same `.prettierrc` file every time which is pure nonsense.

Thus I wrote a bash script to generate the template:

```bash
// Header: prettier.sh
#!/bin/bash

cat > .prettierrc << "EOF"
{
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "singleQuote": true,
  "jsxSingleQuote": true,
  "semi": true,
  "trailingComma": "es5",
  "bracketSpacing": true,
  "jsxBracketSameLine": false,
  "arrowParens": "always",
  "printWidth": 80
}
EOF
```

And added a bash alias:

```bash
// Header: .bash_profile
alias pret="sh ~/Documents/Projects/prettier.sh"
```

Now all I have to do is type `pret` in my terminal!

## üìö **12/6**: Slack logo with CSS Grid

As someone who's been team [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/), I wanted to see what's up with all the hype around [Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/).

The Slack logo fits exactly in a 4 x 4 grid so we're gonna recreate it with divs (please never make your logo and put it on your site as divs omg).

![slack logo](/media/blogmas/slack-logo.png)

For our grid container, we'll declare each cell to be `50px` big and the gap between to be `12px`:

```css
// Header: index.css
.grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 50px 50px 50px 50px;
  grid-template-rows: 50px 50px 50px 50px;
  grid-gap: 12px;
}
```

Now we can fill in with our divs:

```html
// Header: index.html
<div class="grid">
  <div class="blue a"></div>
  <div class="blue b"></div>
  <div class="green a"></div>
  <div class="green b"></div>
  <div class="yellow a"></div>
  <div class="yellow b"></div>
  <div class="red a"></div>
  <div class="red b"></div>
</div>
```

Each div has a color class name as well as `a` if it's one-celled, or `b` if it takes up two cells.

Let's look at the CSS for the blue section:

```css
// Header: index.css
.blue.a {
  grid-column: 2;
  grid-row: 1;
}

.blue.b {
  grid-column: 1 / 3;
  grid-row: 2;
}
```

`.blue.a` only takes up one cell, so we only need to declare its row and column which are `1` and `2` respectively (Grid is 1-indexed):

![slack](/media/blogmas/slack-grid.png#width=300px)

`.blue.b` is in the 2nd row so we put `2` for that. Then for `column`, we use `start / finish` (the div extends _up to_ `finish`). `.blue.b` starts at column 1 and ends right before column 3 which gives us `1 / 3`.

We can fill out the rest of the colors by examining which cells they lie in. I also added more CSS to configure the colors and rounded borders. You can see the demo on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/karenying/pen/gOwPZYZ) and the full code on [GitHub](https://github.com/karenying/css-grid-slack-logo).

Our finished product is pretty close üòÄ

![slack](/media/blogmas/slack.png)

### Overall thoughts

Grid is pretty easy to use! It definitely has a ton of other features that I didn't explore in this simple build. It makes sense to use it for 2D layouts instead of just nesting Flexbox (@me oops). I bet I will frequent CSS-Tricks' [Grid guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) as I start to use Grid more often (the [Flexbox guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) has been a lifesaver).

## üé® **12/7**: Skeleton screens + New preview pic

I think skeleton screens are so cute -- I made one for the desktop view of this site's homepage:

![skeleton](/media/blogmas/skeleton.png)_Peep Figma [file](https://www.figma.com/file/Lsc48j3IOX6mHODbjR3tq8/skeleton-frame?node-id=0%3A1)_

In practice, perhaps only the right side (posts) would be abstracted but I just wanted to simplify as much as possible! And since my site is static, this wouldn't really be applicable anyways üòõ

Skeleton screens, especially with left to right motion animations, make the load time seem faster. I read about them more in depth [here](https://uxdesign.cc/what-you-should-know-about-skeleton-screens-a820c45a571a). Thinking about animating a skeleton screen as a future blogmas post!

Btw, I changed this site's preview pic to a variation of the above skeleton screen:
![preview](/media/blogmas/preview.png)

She cute, she cute af. I'm obsessed ü•∞ (the old preview was the cover image of my <a href="/posts/v2-0-stable-release" target="_blank">v2.0 Stable Release post</a>).

## üìö **12/8**: Intro to neural networks

Hi, my name is Karen and I'm allergic to React class components, supporting IE 11, infra dev, and ... oh yeah, mAcHiNe LeArNiNg.

I'm challenging the last one by doing [Victor Zhou](http://victorzhou.com/)'s top post/tutorial -- [Machine Learning for Beginners: An Introduction to Neural Networks](https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-neural-networks/). I dropped Princeton's ELE 435: Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition, after the midterm so this should be interesting.

Let's do it!

1. **Building Blocks: Neurons**
   - Ya makes sense
   - **Side note**: I always thought NumPy was pronounced "num-pee" but then someone told me it's Numerical Python not Numerical Pee-thon
2. **Combining Neurons into a Neural Network**
   - Mmm we good
3. **Training a Neural Network, Part 1**
   - Still following but MSE is giving me PTSD to my [ORFE](https://orfe.princeton.edu/home) days
4. **Training a Neural Network, Part 2**
   - Alright I was doing okay until we got to the multi part, and then my eyes glazed over üôÑ
   - Well I trust the math/code and SGD makes sense on a high level

### Overall thoughts

The tutorial opens with:

> This post is intended for complete beginners and assumes ZERO prior knowledge of machine learning.

And I mean ya dat me and it was easy enough to follow -- I enjoyed how well-structured it was with the diagrams, tables, code blocks etc.

However, I still feel the same way towards ML -- not really interested in the theory/math behind it because it's a bunch of icky calc and lin alg. Maybe I'd be more interested in the applications (`import sklearn` amiright). But then again, applying ML = training model, waiting for results, tweaking params, repeat ... soooooo I think I'll just stick to web dev.

## ü§î **12/9**: Spotify Wrapped analysis

_Blogged while jamming to my [Top Songs 2020 playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1EMaba5daAs6pY?si=wFKQvUuVT7m7rKz6UlG0BQ)_

I remember reading this [article](https://medium.com/throughdesign/spotify-2019-wrapped-a-design-masterstroke-1d06b27b0aec) about Spotify Wrapped 2019's UI/UX design so here's my analysis of this year's!

We'll start off with the 4 basic colors Spotify used:

![wrapped palette](/media/blogmas/wrapped-palette.png)_Spotify Wrapped 2020 palette created with [Coolors](https://coolors.co/)_

I've written about this [before](https://blog.karenying.com/posts/50-shades-of-dark-mode-gray#spotify-macos-app) -- Spotify's dark-mode only UI allows for colorful album art to pop, just like how theaters dim their lights for shows. Thus, these 4 bright colors especially stand out amongst the darker backgrounds. You can even see this effect with the background color on _this_ site.

![wrapped banner](/media/blogmas/wrapped-banner.PNG#width=300px)

With these 4 colors, Spotify only uses 2 pairings throughout the story -- dark blue with green, and pink with cyan. These pairings have relatively high [contrast ratios](https://blog.karenying.com/posts/boost-visual-accessibility-by-auto-flipping-text-color#wcag-and-contrast-ratio) which makes text legible (light green with cyan would be too hard to read). Here's an example of dark pink on cyan:

![wrapped cover](/media/blogmas/wrapped-cover.PNG#width=300px)

In addition to this fixed color palette, Spotify also uses a rainbow-ish gradient as a common theme. This vertical gradient features the dark blue, cyan, and green from the palette, as well as black and warmer sunset-like hues. It appears primarily as a background, with the other 4 colors in the foreground.

You would think that this combo of colors from all across the spectrum would clash. However, IMO the gradient really ties the contrasting colors together. You get a sort of tropical, beachy, summery vibe instead.

These bright colors, along with encouraging, uplifting comments such as:

> Even in 2020, you still found ways to grow

> You're a pioneer

make you reflect on your year of music with a positive attitude. And that's their goal -- to make you like this recap so much that you share it with friends and on social media (if you didn't IG story it, did you even listen to music?). Spotify's stock [soared](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/spotify-stock-jumps-wrapped-report-joe-rogan-exclusivity/) because of this Wrapped hype. Clearly they have found a winning marketing/branding strat.

And here's my 2020 Spotify Wrapped:

![my wrapped](/media/blogmas/wrapped-me.JPG#width=300px)

Just a girl who likes to beep boop to beep boop music!
