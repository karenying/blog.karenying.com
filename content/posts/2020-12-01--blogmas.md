Welcome to Blogmas 2020 üéä

In the spirit of [Vlogmas](https://filmora.wondershare.com/family-n-personal/what-is-vlogmas.html), I'm participating in Blogmas -- this megapost where I blog daily about something I coded or learned that day.

I'll be tackling side project improvements (including this blog!), exploring new technologies, and building potentially useless things. My [GitHub](https://github.com/karenying) contributions graph and [free-tier](https://www.netlify.com/pricing/) [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) build minutes are not ready (I [enabled](https://github.com/karenying/blog.karenying.com/commit/9b70c026a33fd71a4a6613ac919abd87ef077928) [Gatsby incremental builds](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/23/enable-gatsby-incremental-builds-on-netlify/) for this).

## ‚öôÔ∏è 12/1: Bash alias for ISO 8601 formatted time

The [frontmatter](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/adding-markdown-pages/#frontmatter-for-metadata-in-markdown-files) of every blog post requires a timestamp to display on the post and feed. The [Lumen starter](https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen) that I used had the timestamp formatted in [ISO 8601](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime):

```yaml
date: '2017-08-18T22:12:03.284Z'
```

The `Z` at the end means that the timezone is UTC -- Coordinated Universal Time.

Initially, I was lazy and kept the time as is, only changing the date. Then I decided I wanted the date AND time to accurately reflect when I posted. I would Google "UTC time now" and fill in the details manually -- for some reason I thought this was more efficient than one time figuring out how to account for timezone in ISO 8601.

Thus, I'm finally creating a bash alias called `iso_date` that returns an ISO 8601 date for my frontmatter.

**Side note**: I recently [transitioned](https://github.com/karenying/blog.karenying.com/commit/b8a126413d116d5bd1cc9ecbe45339a35742486b) from using [Moment](https://momentjs.com/) to [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/) and am using `fromISO` to [parse](https://moment.github.io/luxon/docs/class/src/datetime.js~DateTime.html#static-method-fromISO) the frontmatter date.

Bash has a [built in](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/unix-linux-bash-get-time/) `date` command with field descriptors. With this, we can create our bash alias. We need `%Y`, `%m`, `%d`, `%H`, `%M`, `%S`, and `%z`.

We want our string to look like `%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z`. This returns the time in your current timezone which is more readable IMO. It should work as expected:

```bash
$ date +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z
2020-12-01T08:11:10-0500
```

### Save the command

Open `.bash_profile`:

```bash
// Header: .bash_profile
vim ~/.bash_profile
```

add the alias:

```bash
alias iso_date="date +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z"
```

Restart the terminal and yay no more Googling UTC time!

## üé® 12/2: Animate SVG hamburger menu to x

I've always wanted to make a cool SVG animation. The classic example is smoothly animating a hamburger menu to a close icon:

![](/media/blogmas/menu.gif#width=300px)<i><center>What I ended up creating. CodePen <a href="https://codepen.io/karenying/pen/MWjwzMo" target="_blank">here</a></center></i>

I referenced these two CodePens as inspiration/help:

- [Hamburger Menu](https://codepen.io/ainalem/pen/wvKOEMV) by [Mikael Ainalem](https://codepen.io/ainalem)
- [Pure CSS hamburger icons transition](https://codepen.io/tonkec/pen/XXgdoo) by [Antonija ≈†imiƒá](https://codepen.io/tonkec)

### Implementation

The skeleton HTML SVG code:

```html
// Header: index.html
<svg width="100" height="100" viewBox="0 0 100 100">
  <path class="line top" d="M 20,30 H 80" />
  <path class="line middle" d="M 20,50 H 80" />
  <path class="line bottom" d="M 20,70 H 80" />
</svg>
```

`<path>` elements draw the lines based on `M` (move to `x, y`) and `H` (horizontal line to `x`). So this snippet draws three horizontal lines.

And we'll define some CSS for these lines:

```css
// Header: index.css
.line {
  stroke-width: 6;
  stroke-linecap: round;
  stroke: #8deaff;
  transition: all 500ms;
}
```

- `stroke-width` determines how thicc the lines are
- `stroke-linecap` changes the ends of the lines to round
  - Side note: `stroke-linecap: butt` is the [default value](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/s/stroke-linecap/#values) üçë
- `stroke` sets the color
- `transition` is normal CSS -- we want all the transitions to occur over half a second

Now, we use more CSS to animate the lines on hover via class selectors. Specifically, we want the top and bottom lines to rotate 45 degrees about their left ends and we want the middle line to disappear.

For the top and bottom lines we need to set their `transform-origin` initially:

```css
// Header: index.css
.top {
  transform-origin: 26px 40px;
}

.bottom {
  transform-origin: 26px 60px;
}
```

I had to play around with `transform-origin` to get them to rotate as expected.

And for the middle bar:

```css
// Header: index.css
.middle {
  stroke-dasharray: 60 60;
}
```

We initialize the line to have 60 dashes. In order for the initial appearance to look gapless, we display all 60 dashes. When we transform, we'll only show one dash.

CSS for the hover effects:

```css
// Header: index.css
.menu:hover .line {
  stroke: #ff7c7c;
}

.menu:hover .top {
  transform: rotate(45deg);
}

.menu:hover .middle {
  stroke-dasharray: 1 60;
  stroke-dashoffset: -30;
}

.menu:hover .bottom {
  transform: rotate(-45deg);
}
```

Every line changes color, we rotate top and bottom, and reduce the middle line to one dash while moving it to the middle!

## ‚öôÔ∏è 12/3: VSCode Snippets

I looked into [VSCode Snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets) today and made my own to help speed up React development in particular.

### Empty function component: `comp`

**Snippet**:

```json
{
  "react functional component": {
    "scope": "javascript",
    "prefix": "comp",
    "body": ["const $1 = ({ $2 }) => {", "", "\treturn (", "", "\t)", "}"]
  }
}
```

**Output**:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```jsx
const /* 1st cursor */ = ({ /* 2nd cursor */ }) => {

  return (

  )
}
```

### useEffect hook: `useE`

**Snippet**:

```json
{
  "useEffect hook": {
    "scope": "javascript, typescript, javascriptreact, typescriptreact",
    "prefix": "useE",
    "body": ["useEffect(() => {", "\t$1", "})"]
  }
}
```

**Output**:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  /* CURSOR */
})
```

### useState hook: `useS`

**Snippet**:

```json
{
  "useState hook": {
    "scope": "javascript, typescript, javascriptreact, typescriptreact",
    "prefix": "useS",
    "body": ["const [$1, $2] = useState($3);$0"]
  }
}
```

**Output**:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```jsx
const [/* 1st */, /* 2nd */] = useState(/* 3rd */);
```

### ClassName: `cla`

**Snippet**:

```json
{
  "className": {
    "scope": "javascript, typescript, javascriptreact, typescriptreact",
    "prefix": "cla",
    "body": ["className=\"$1\""]
  }
}
```

**Output**:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```jsx
className="[CURSOR]"
```

## üìö 12/4: Leetcoding in Julia

**Confession time**: I got to name my sister and I named her Julia. I think I told my parents I picked it because I thought it was a pretty name. But actually, I named her after this girl I hated in preschool. See, I was upset that my sister's birth meant that we couldn't go to Disney World because she was too young. So I did the pettiest thing a 4 y/o could think of üòà

Anyways, I thought I'd try out the language that has been coined "the next Python", [Julia](https://julialang.org/). What better way to learn a new language than to solve the classic [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problem, [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/), with it?

I'm too lazy to configure the environment so I'm using an [online IDE](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_julia_online.php) instead.

Here's my solution:

```julia
// Header: main.jl
function twosum(nums, target)
  d = Dict()

  for i in eachindex(nums)
    if haskey(d, (target - nums[i]))
      return [d[target - nums[i]], i]
    else
      d[nums[i]] = i
    end
  end
end

@show twosum([2,7,11,15], 9)
```

Running it, we get:

```bash
$julia main.jl
twosum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9) = [1, 2]
```

### Initial comments

- The syntax strikes me as a mix between Python and Ruby
- Arrays and dictionaries operate as expected, with the exception of `haskey` to check if a key is in the dictionary
- `@show` [macro](https://riptutorial.com/julia-lang/example/6355/reimplementing-the--show-macro) is cool

### Overall thoughts

Julia was designed for performance in mind which is always _s e x y_. While my solution is untyped, Julia is dynamically typed. We also love being ~flexy~. BUT the one thing I can't get on board with is 1-based indexing ü§Æ All in all impressed, I like it, and excited to see more mainstream usage!

## ‚öôÔ∏è 12/5: Auto generate Prettier config

[Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) is one of my favorite VSCode extensions. I like creating a Prettier config for every project based on the same template and tweak it slightly depending on the proj. I found myself copy and pasting the same `.prettierrc` file every time which is pure nonsense.

Thus I wrote a bash script to generate the template:

```bash
// Header: prettier.sh
#!/bin/bash

cat > .prettierrc << "EOF"
{
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "singleQuote": true,
  "jsxSingleQuote": true,
  "semi": true,
  "trailingComma": "es5",
  "bracketSpacing": true,
  "jsxBracketSameLine": false,
  "arrowParens": "always",
  "printWidth": 80
}
EOF
```

And added a bash alias:

```bash
// Header: .bash_profile
alias pret="sh ~/Documents/Projects/prettier.sh"
```

Now all I have to do is type `pret` in my terminal!
